A.  The first letter in the English and most other alpha­ 
bets derived from the Roman or Latin alphabet, which 
was one of several ancient Italian alphabets derived 
from the Greek, which was an adaptation of the Phoeni­ 
cian. The first letter in the Phoenician alphabet was 
called aleph, meaning "ox", which is also the meaning of 
the first letter in the Greek alphabet, alpha. Alpha and 
the 
combined to form "alphabet," which is largely the same

was an abbreviation for "Aulus," a praenomen, or the 
first of the usual three names of a person by which he 
was distinguished from others of the same family; also 
for "ante" in "a.d.," ante diem (before the day), and for 
"anno" (year) in a.u.c., anno urbis conditae (the year of 
the building of the city) and in anno ab urbe condita 
(from the year of the building of the city). As a preposi­ 
tion, the form was either A, AB or ABS. A was used
before consonants; ab was usually used before vowels,

but sometimes before consonants, whereas abs was used

from," "on the side of," "at," "after," "since," "by," "by 
means of," "out of," "with reference to," "in regard of,"

"near by," and "along." For example, A fronte in front;

A in French and law French. In French A is a preposi­

 tion, the meaning of which largely depends on context.

 It is usually translated as "into," "at," "to," "in," "by,"

 "of," "with," "on," "from," "for," "under," "till," "with­

 in," "between," etc. It also changes into au and aux

 when combined with "the." A is also the third person,

 singular number, present tense, indicative mood of the

 verb avoir, (to have): II a (he has). In law French "a" is 
 used as a preposition meaning "at," "for," "in," "of," 
 
   The word "a" has varying meanings and uses. "A"
 means "one" or "any," but less emphatically than ei­

 ther. It may mean one where only one is intended, or it 
 
 before nouns of the singular number, denoting an indi­ 
 
  The article "a" is not necessarily a singular term; it is
  often used in the sense of "any" and is then applied to
  more than one individual object. Lewis v. Spies, 43
  A.D.2d 714, 350 N.Y.S.2d 14, 17. So under a statute
  providing that the issuance of "a" certificate to one
  carrier should not bar a certificate to another over the
  same route, a certificate could be granted to more than
  two carriers over the same route. State ex reL Crown
  Coach Co. v. Public Service Commission, 238 Mo.App.
  287, 179 S.W.2d 123, 127. Also, article "a" in statute
  making it a crime for a person to have in his possession
  a completed check with intent to defraud includes the
  plural. People v. Carter, 75 C.A.3d 865, 142 CaLRptr.
  517, 520. But the meaning depends on context. For
r example "A"                 example, in Workers' Compensation Act, on, or in or
  about "a" railway, factory, etc., was held not to mean
  any railway, factory, etc., but the railway, factory, etc.,
s of the same family; also             of the employer. Where the law required the delivery of
  a copy of a notice to husband and a copy to wife, the
  sheriffs return. that he had delivered "a copy" to hus­
  band and wife was insufficient. State v. Davis, Tex.Civ.

  Ab.   The eleventh month of the Jewish civil year, and
  the fifth of the sacred year. It answers to the moon that
  begins in July, and consists of thirty days. On the 24th
  is observed a feast in memory of the abolishment of the
  Sadducean law, which required sons and daughters to be
  equal heirs and heiresses of their parents' estates.
  Ab, at the beginning of English-Saxon names of
  places, is generally a contraction of abbot or abbey;
  whence it is inferred that those places once had an
  abbey there, or belonged to one elsewhere, as Abingdon

Abandonment.       The surrender, relinquishment, dis­ 
 claimer, or cession of property or of rights. Voluntary 
 relinquishment of all right, title, claim and possession, 
 with the intention of not reclaiming it. State v. Bailey, 
  97 N.J.Super. 396, 235 A.2d 214, 216. The giving up of a
  thing absolutely, without reference to any particular
  person or purpose, as vacating property with the inten­
  tion of not returning, so that it may be appropriated by
  the next comer or finder. The voluntary relinquish­
  ment of possession of thing by owner with intention of
  terminating his ownership, but without vesting it in any
  other person. Dober v. Ukase Inv. Co., 139 Or. 626, 10
  P.2d 356, 357. The relinquishing of all title, possession,
  or claim, or a virtual, intentional throwing away of
  property.
  Term includes both the intention to abandon and the
  external act by which the intention is carried into effect.
  In determining whether one has abandoned his property
  or rights, the intention is the first and paramount object
  of inquiry, for there can be no abandonment without the
  intention to abandon. Roebuck v. Mecosta County Road
  Commission, 59 Mich.App. 128, 229 N.W.2d 343, 345.
  Generally,"abandonment" can arise from a single act or
  from a series of acts. Holly Hill Lumber Co. v. Grooms,
  198 S.C. 118, 16 S.E.2d 816, 821.
  Time is not an essential element of act, although the
  lapse of time may be evidence of an intention to aban­
  don, and where it is accompanied by acts manifesting
  such an intention, it may be considered in determining
  whether there has been an abandonment. Ullman ex
  reI. Eramo v. Payne, 127 Conn. 239, 16 A.2d 286, 287.
  "Abandonment" differs from surrender in that surren­
  der requires an agreement, and also from forfeiture,
  in that forfeiture may be against the intention of the
  party alleged to have forfeited.

  Actions, in general. Failure to prosecute or bring action
  within statutorily prescribed period (see Limitations (Stat­
  ute of limitations) ; failure to object to or submit jury
  instructions (Fed.R. Civil P. 51); failure to demand jury
  trial (Fed.R. Civil P. 38).
  Adverse possession.   To destroy continuity of adverse
  claimant's possession, there must be an intent to relin­
  quish claim of ownership as well as an act of relinquish­
  ment of possession and mere temporary absence is not
  sufficient. Bruch v. Benedict, 62 Wyo. 213, 165 P.2d
  561.

  v. Hendrix, 311 Ill.App. 605, 37 N.E.2d 445, 446. Error

  parental duties. Wright v. Fitzgibbons, 198 Miss. 471,
  21 So.2d 709, 710. See also Desertion.
  Contracts.   To constitute "abandonment" by conduct,
  action relied on must be positive, decisive, unequivocal,
  and inconsistent with the existence of the contract.
  Abandonment is a matter of intent, Lohn v. Fletcher Oil
  Co., 38 Cal.App.2d 26, 100 P.2d 505, 507, and implies not
        only nonperforma
        which may be inferred from acts which necessarily point 
 
        Copyright. "Abandonment" of a copyright turns on

        state of mind of copyright proprietor and occurs whenev­

        er he engages in some overt action which manifests his

        purpose to surrender his rights in the work and to allow

        the public to enjoy it. Rexnord, Inc. v. Modern Han­

        dling Systems, Inc., D.C.Del., 379 F.Supp. 1190, 1199.

        Criminal acts. "Abandonment" can relieve one of crim­ 
        inal responsibility where criminal enterprise is cut short 
        by change of heart, desertion of criminal purpose, 
        change of behavior, and rising revulsion for harm in­ 
        tended, and must occur before criminal act charged is in 
        the process of consummation or has become so inevitable 
        that it cannot reasonably be delayed. Pyle v. State,

        Ind., 476 N.E.2d 124, 126. See Model Penal Code 
        § 5.01(4) (renunciation of criminal purpose). 
        Easements.   To establish "abandonment" of an ease­ 
        ment created by deed, there must be some conduct on 
        part of owner of servient estate adverse to and inconsist­ 
        ent with existence of easement and continuing for statu­ 
        tory period, or nonuser must be accompanied by un­ 
        equivocal and decisive acts clearly indicating an intent 
        on part of owner of easement to abandon use of it. 
        Permanent cessation of use or enjoyment with no inten­ 
        tion to resume or reclaim. Intention and completed act 
        are both essential. A mere temporary or occasional 
        obstruction or use of an easement by the servient owner 
        is not an "abandonment". Gerber v. Appel, Mo.App., 
 
    _   Ground for divorce. "Abandonment" as cause for di- 
.
        vorce must be willful and intentional without intention 
        of returning, and without consent of spouse abandoned. 
        This ground is commonly termed "desertion" in state 
 
        Inventions.   The giving up of rights by inventor, as 
        where he surrenders his idea or discovery or relinquish­ 
        es the intention of perfecting his invention, and so 
        throws it open to the public, or where he negligently 
        postpones the assertion of his claims or fails to apply for 
        a patent, and allows the public to use his invention. 
        Electric Storage Battery Co. v. Shimacizu, Pa., 307 U.S. 
        5, 613, 616, 59 S.Ct. 675, 681, 83 L.Ed. 1071. 
        Leases in general. To constitute an "abandonment" of 
        leased premises, there must be an absolute relinquish­

        ment of premises by tenant consisting of act and inten­ 
 
        Mineral leases.   "Abandonment" consists of an actual 
        act of relinquishment, accompanied with the intent and 
        purpose permanently to give up a claim and right of 
        property. A distinction exists between "abandonment" 
        and "surrender" which is the relinquishment of a thing 
        or a property right thereto to another, which is not an 
        essential element of abandonment. Distinction also ex­ 
        ists between elements of "abandonment" and those of 
        estoppel. Neither formal surrender of oil and gas lease 
        nor release is necessary to effectuate "abandonment; for 
  example, failing to start work under the lease for more
  than 40 years, Chapman v. Continental Oil Co., 149 Kan.
  822, 89 P.2d 833, 834; breach of implied obligation to
  proceed with search and development of land with rea­
  sonable diligence, Wood v. Arkansas Fuel Oil Co., D.C.
­
  Ark., 40 F.Supp. 42, 45; no drilling on leased land for
  more than two years, and failure to pay rentals, Rehart
w
  v. Klossner, 48 Cal.App.2d 40, 119 P.2d 145, 147; draw­
  ing of casing from well with no intention of replacing it,
  have all been held to constitute "abandonment". But
  there must be an intention by lessee to relinquish leased
  premises, Carter Oil Co. v. Mitchell, C.C.A.Okl., 100 F.2d
  945, 950, 951; or an intention not to drill, Carter Oil Co.
  v. Mitchell, C.C.A.Okl., 100 F.2d 945, 950, 951. And
  ceasing of operations is not alone sufficient. Fisher v.
  Dixon, 188 Oklo 7, 105 P.2d 776, 777.
  Office.  Abandonment of a public office is a species of
  resignation, but differs from resignation in that resigna­
  tion is a formal relinquishment, while abandonment is a
  voluntary relinquishment through nonuser. It is not
  wholly a matter of intention, but may result from the
  complete abandonment of duties of such a continuance
  that the law will infer a relinquishment. It must be
  total, and under such circumstances as clearly to indi­
  cate an absolute relinquishment; and whether an officer
  has abandoned an office depends on his overt acts rather
  than his declared intention. It implies nonuser, but
  nonuser does not, of itself constitute abandonment. The
  failure to perform the duties pertaining to the office
  must be with actual or imputed intention on the part of
  the officer to abandon and relinquish the office. The
  intention may be inferred from the acts and conduct of
  the party, and is a question of fact. Abandonment may
  result from an acquiescence by the officer in his wrong­
  ful removal or discharge, but, as in other cases of aban­
  donment, the question of intention is involved. McCall
  v. Cull, 51 Ariz. 237, 75 P.2d 696, 698.
  Patents.   There may be an abandonment of a patent,
  where he surrenders his idea or discovery or relinquish­      where the inventor dedicates it to the public use; and
  this may be shown by his failure to sue infringers, sell
  licenses, or otherwise make efforts to realize a personal
  advantage from his patent. Sandlin v. Johnson, C.C.A.
  Mo., 141 F.2d 660. A person may not be deprived of a
  patent as a result of the earlier work of another if that
  work has been abandoned, supplemented, or concealed.
  35 U.S.C.A. § 102(g).
  Property. "Abandoned property" in a legal sense is that
  to which owner has relinquished all right, title, claim,
  and possession, but without vesting it in any other
  person, and with no intention of not reclaiming it or
  resuming its ownership, possession or enjoyment in the
  future. Com. v. Carter, 236 Pa.Super. 376, 344 A.2d 899,
  901. There must be concurrence of act and intent, that
  is, the act of leaving the premises or property vacant, so
  that it may be appropriated by the next comer, and the
  intention of not returning. Relinquishment of all title,
  possession, or claim; a virtual intentional throwing
  away of property. Ex parte Szczygiel, Sup., 51 N.Y.S.2d
  699, 702.
 Rights in general.  The relinquishment of a right. It 
 implies some act of relinquishment done by the owner 
 without regard to any future possession by himself, or 
 by any other person, but with an intention to abandon.

 
 See Waiver.
 
 Trademarks and trade names. There must be not only 
 nonuser, but also an intent to abandon and to give up

 
 use of trademarks permanently. Neva-Wet Corporation

 
 of America v. Never Wet Processing Corporation, 277

 
 N.Y. 163, 13 N.E.2d 755, 761.
 
 Water rights. As applied to water rights may be defined 
 to be an intentional relinquishment of a known right.

 
 It is not based on a time element, and mere nonuser will

 not establish "abandonment" for any less time, at least, 
 than statutory period, controlling element in "abandon­ 
 ment" being matter of intent. Hammond v. Johnson, 94 
 Utah 20, 66 P.2d 894, 899. To desert or forsake right. 
 The intent and an actual relinquishment must concur. 
 Concurrence of relinquishment of possession, and intent 
 not to resume it for beneficial use. Neither alone is

 
 sufficient. Osnes Livestock Co. v. Warren, 103 Mont.

 employe
 established trades or professions are known as the "ABC

 away the smaller animals, as swine, sheep, and goats. 
 In the latter case, it depended on the number taken, 
  whether the offender was fur (a common thief) or abi­
  geus. But the taking of a single horse or ox seems to
  have constituted the crime of abigeatus. And those who
  frequently did this were clearly abigei, though they took
  but an animal or two at a time.         4 Bl.Comm. 239.

flexible significance, varying with the circumstances and 
the connection in which it is employed. But its use does 
n
contract one terminable at will. In a charter party, 
"about to sail" means just ready to sail. With relation 
to quantity, the term suggests only an estimate of proba­ 
ble amount. Its import is that the actual quantity is a 
near approximation to that mentioned, and it has the 
effect of providing against accidental variations. Nor­ 
rington v. Wright, 115 U.S. 188, 6 S.Ct. 12, 29 L.Ed. 366.

 Copyright law. To epitomize; to reduce; to contract. It

 implies preserving the substance, the essence, of a work, 
 in language suited to such a purpose. In making ex­ 
 tracts there is no condensation of the author's language, 
 
 exercise of the mind; it is not copying. Between a 
 compilation and an abridgment there is a clear distinc­ 
 tion. A compilation consists of selected extracts from 
 different authors; an abridgment is a condensation of 
 
A
 or compendium of another and larger work, wherein the 
 principal ideas of the larger work are summarily con­

 
 tained. Abridgments of the law are brief digests of the

 "digest" (q. v.) has generally supplanted that of "abridg­

  Abrogation lrebr�geysh�n/. The destruction or annul­
  ling of a former law, by an act of the legislative power,
  by constitutional authority, or by usage. It stands op­
  posed to rogation ; and is distinguished from derogation,
  which implies the taking away only some part of a law;
  from subrogation, which denotes the substitution of a
  clause; from dispensation, which only sets it aside in a
  particular instance; and from antiquation, which is the
  refusing to pass a law. Implied abrogation takes place
  when the new law contains provisions which are posi­
  tively contrary to former laws, without expressly abro­
  gating such laws; and also when the order of things for
  which the law has been made no longer exists. Ex parte

 viated form of the case as found in the record, complete

  Discretion. "Abuse of discretion" is synonymous with a
  failure to exercise a sound, reasonable, and legal discre­
  tion. It is a strict legal term indicating that appellate
  court is of opinion that there was commission of an error
  of law by the trial court. It does not imply intentional
  wrong or bad faith, or misconduct, nor any reflection on
  the judge but means the clearly erroneous conclusion
  and judgment-one is that clearly against logic and
  effect of such facts as are presented in support of the
  application or against the reasonable and probable de­
  ductions to be drawn from the facts disclosed upon the
  hearing; an improvident exercise of discretion; an error
  of law. State v. Draper, 83 Utah 115, 27 P.2d 39; Ex
  parte Jones, 246 Ala. 433, 20 So.2d 859, 862. A discre­
  tion exercised to an end or purpose not justified by and
  clearly against reasor! and evidence. Unreasonable de­
  parture from considered precedents and settled judicial

Inc., C.C.A.Pa., 122 F.2d 114, 116, 117. A judgment or 
decision by an administrative agency or judge which has 
no foundation in fact or in law. "Abuse of discretion" 
by trial court is any unreasonable, unconscionable and 
arbitrary action taken without proper consideration of

 
facts and law pertaining to matter submitted. Harvey

v. State, Okl.Cr., 458 P.2d 336, 338.
D
Female child.    An injury to the genital organs in an 
attempt at carnal 
penetration. Lee v. State, 246 Ala. 69, 18 So.2d 706, 
707. But, according to other authorities, "abuse" is here 
equivalent to ravishment or rape. Any injury to private 
parts of girl constitutes "abuse" within meaning of crim­ 
inal statute proscribing abuse of girl under age of 12 
years in attempt to have carnal knowledge of her; mere 
hurting of private parts of girl, even though they are not 
bruised, cut, lacerated or torn, is sufficient. Ard v.

State, 57 Ala.App. 250, 327 So.2d 745, 747. See also

obstructing, resisting, or abusing an officer, word "abus­

trary to law. Improper use of power, distinguished from 
usurpation of power which presupposes exercise of pow­ 
er not vested in the offender. Swenson v. Cahoon, 111

Rrocess. The gist of an action for "abuse of process" is

improper use or perversion of process after it has been 
issued. Publix Drug Co. v. Breyer Ice Cream Co., 347 
Pa. 346, 32 A.2d 413, 415. A malicious abuse of legal 
p
unlawful object, not the purpose which it is intended by 
the law to effect; in other words, a perversion of it. 500 
West 174 St. v. Vasquez, 67 Misc.2d 
256, 258. Thus, where the pm'pose of a prosecution for

issuance of a check without funds was to collect a debt, 
the prosecution is an abuse of criminal process. Regular 
a
intention, is not a malicious "abuse of process." Priest 
v. Union Agency, 174 Tenn. 304, 125 S.W.2d 142, 143. 
Action for "abuse of process" is distinguished from ac­ 
tion for "malicious prosecution," in that action for abuse 
of process rests upon improper use of regularly issued 
process, while "malicious prosecution" has reference to 
wrong in issuance of 
N
  Fundamental elements of this tort
purpose, and a willful act in the use of process not 
proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding. Bar­

  joins at a border or boundary, as where no other land,

  Ale Abbreviation used by accountants and bookkeepers
  meaning "account." As used in a check, it has been

  not necessarily the right to teach evil. Kay v. Bd. of
  Higher Education of City of N. Y., 173 Misc. 943, 18
  N.Y.S.2d 821, 829. The term encompasses much more
  than teaching-related speech rights of teachers. Cary v.

  Aurora, Colo., C.A.Colo., 598 F.2d 535.
  Academic question. An issue which does not require

 and also to the lowest depths. Or, Cujus est solum est 
 u sque ad crelum,-the owner of the soil owns to the

 heavens. This doctrine has, however, been abrogated;

 the flight of airplanes and oil and gas regulations have

 qualified the owner's dominion not only in the heavens

issue policy. Acacia Mut. Life Ass'n v. Berry, 54 Ariz.

 
208, 94 P.2d 770, 772. Delay or inaction on the part of

Sale of goods.   U.C.C. § 2-606 provides three ways a

buyer can accept goods: (1) by signifying to the seller

them in spite of their nonconformity, (2) by failing to 
make an effecti
inconsistent with the seller's ownership. Acceptance of 
a part 
e
 
 Conditional. An engagement to pay the draft or accept 
 the offer on the happening of a condition. A "condi­ 
 tional acceptance" is in effect a statement that the 
 offeree is willing to enter into a bargain differing in 
 some respects from that proposed in the original offer. 
 The conditional acceptance is, therefore, itself a coun­ 
 
  Express.  An undertaking in direct and express terms
  to perform the terms of the contract, pay the bill, draft,
  etc.; an absolute acceptance.
  Implied.  An undertaking to pay the draft inferred
  from acts of the drawee of a character which fairly
  warrant such an inference. In case of a bilateral
  contract, "acceptance" of an offer need not be ex­
  pressed, but may be shown by any words or acts indi­
  cating the offeree's assent to the proposed bargain.
  Qualified. One either conditional or partial, and
  which introduces a variation in the sum, mode, or place
  of payment. In contract law, an acceptance based on a
  variation of the terms of the offer and hence a counter­
  offer. In negotiable instruments, a variation in the
  terms of the instrument by the acceptor.

  Acceptilation I reksept�leysh�nl . In the civil and Scotch
  law, release made by a creditor to his debtor of his debt,
  without receiving any consideration. It is a species of
  donation, but not subject to the forms of the latter, and
  is valid unless in fraud of creditors. The verbal extinc­
  tion of a verbal contract, with a declaration that the
  debt has been paid when it has not; or the acceptance of
  something merely imaginary in satisfaction of a verbal
  contract.
  Acceptor. The person (the drawee) who accepts a draft
  and who engages to be primarily responsible for its
  payment. One who engages that he will pay the draft
  according to its tenor at the time of his engagement or
  as completed pursuant to authority on incomplete in­

  honor of the drawer or any one of the indorsers.
  Access. Freedom of approach or communication; or the
  means, power, or opportunity of approaching, communi­
  cating, or passing to and from. Sometimes importing
  the occurrence of sexual intercourse, Jackson v. Jack­
  son, 182 Okl. 74, 76 P.2d 1062, 1066; otherwise as
  importing opportunity of communication for that pur­
  pose as between husband and wife.
  In real property law, the term "access" denotes the
  right vested in the owner of land which adjoins a road or
  other highway to go and return from his own land to the
  highway without obstruction. "Access" to property does
  not necessarily carry with it possession. People v. Bren­
  neauer, 101 Misc. 156, 166 N.Y.S. 801, 806. See Access,
  easement of.
  For purposes of establishing element of access by
  defendant in copyright infringement action, "access" is
 ordinarily defined as opportunity to copy.        Musto v. 
 
 Multiple access. The defense of several lovers in pater­ 
 nity actions.     Yarmark v. Strickland, 193 So.2d 212. 
 Public records.
 includes not only a legal right of access but a reasonable 
 opportunity to avail oneself of the same. See Freedom

 
Accessary. See Accessory.
Access, easement 
 of access is the right which an abutting owner has of

 ingress to and egress from his premises, in addition to 
 
Accessio lreksesh(iy)ow/. In Roman law, an increase or 
 addition; that which lies next to a thing, and is supple­ 
 menta
 which arises or is produced from the principal thing; an 
 "accessory obligation" (q. v.). One of the modes of ac­ 
 quiring property, being the extension of ownership over 
 that which grows from, or is united to, an article which 
 
 Accessio includes both accession and accretion as used in 
 
Accession. Coming into possession of a right or office;

 increase; augmentation; addition.
   The right to all which one's own property produces,

 whether that property be movable or immovable; and

 the right to that which is united to it by accession,

 either naturally or artificially. The right to own things 
 that become a part of something already ' owned; e.g. 
 riparian owners' right to abando
 rights of alluvion by accretion and reliction. Manry v. 
 Robison, 122 Tex. 213, 56 S.W.2d 438, 443, 444. See 
 
   A principle derived from the civil law, by which the 
 owner of property becomes entitled to all which it pro­ 
 duces, and to all that is added or united to it, either 
 naturally or artificially, (that is, by the labor or skill of 
 another) even where such addition extends to a change 
 of form or materials; and by which, on the other hand, 
 the possessor of property becomes entitled to it, as 
 against the original owner, where the addition made to 
 it by his skill and labor is of greater value than the 
 property itself, or where the change effected in its form 
 is so great as to render it impossible to restore it to its 
 
   Generally, "accession" signifies acquisition of title to 
 personal property by bestowing labor on it which con­

 verts it into an entirely different thing or by incorpo­

 ration of property into a union with other property.

 App., 590 S.W.2d 607, 609.
   The commencement or inauguration of a sovereign's 
 
 International law. The absolute or conditional accept­ 
 ance by 
 concluded between other sovereignties. It may be of two 
  kinds: First, the formal entrance of a third nation into a
  treaty so that such nation becomes a party to it; and
  this can only be with the consent of the original parties.
  Second, a nation may accede to a treaty between other
  nations solely for the purpose of guarantee, in which
  case, though a party, it is affected by the treaty only as
  a guarantor. See Adhesion.

  who is accessory to a crime cannot be guilty of a higher
  degree of crime than his principal.

  as an ornament, or to render it more perfect, or which
  accompanies it, or is connected with it as an incident, or
  as subordinate to it, or which belongs to or with it.

  ondary way or assisting in or contributing to as a
  subordinate. Gilfoil v. Greenspon, La.App., 216 So.2d

  Criminal law. Contributing to or aiding in the commis­
  sion of a crime. One who, without being present at the
  commission of a felonious offense, becomes guilty of such
  offense, not as a chief actor, but as a participator, as by
  command, advice, instigation, or concealment; either
  before or after the fact or commission; a particeps
  criminis. Model Penal Code, § 2.06.
  One who is not the chief actor in the offense, nor
  present at its performance, but in some way concerned
  therein, either before or after the act committed. One
  who aids, abets, commands, or counsels another in the
  commission of a crime. See also Abettor; Aid and abet;
  Accomplice.
  Accessory after the fact.     A person who, knowing a
  felony to have been committed by another, receives,
  relieves, comforts or assists the felon, in order to enable
  him to escape from punishment, or the like. Robinson

  A.2d 293, 294. The primary distinction between the
  accessory before the fact and the principal in the sec­
  ond degree is presence. Virtually all states have now
  expressly abrogated' the distinction between principals
  and accessories before the fact; the latter now being
  classified as principals.

Accident. The word "accident" is derived from the
 Latin verb "accidere" signifying "fall upon, befall, hap­

 pen, chance." In an etymological sense anything that

 happens may be said to be an accident and in this sense,

 the word has been defined as befalling a change; a

 happening; an incident; an occurrence or event. In its

 most commonly accepted meaning, or in its ordinary or

 popular sense, the word may be defined as meaning: a 
 fortuitous circumstance, event,
 happening 
 wholly or partly through human agency, an event which 
 under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by 
 the person to whom it happens; an unusual, fortuitous, 
 unexpected, unforeseen or unlooked for event, happen­ 
 ing or occurrence; an unusual or unexpecte
 attending the operation or 
 necessary act or event; chance or contingency; fortune; 
 
 place without expectation, upon the instant, rather than 
 something which continues, progresses or develops; 
 something happening by chance; something unforeseen, 
 unexpected, unusual, extraordinary or phenomenal, tak­ 
 ing place not according to the usual course of things or 
 events, out of the range of ordinary calculations; that 
 
 occurrence. The word may
 calamity, casualty, catastrophe, disaster, an undesirable 
 or unfortunate happening; any unexpected personal in­ 
 jury resulting from any unlooked for mishap or occur- 
  rence; any unpleasant or unfortunate occurrence, that
  causes injury, loss, suffering or death; some untoward
  occurrence aside from the usual course of events. An
  event that takes place without one's foresight or expec­
  tation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.
  Kochring Co. v. American Auto. Ins. Co., C.A.Wis., 353

  policy requiring notice of any "accident" to be given to
  the insurer as a condition precedent to liability means
  an untoward and unforeseen occurrence in the operation
  of the automobile which results in injury to the person
  or property of another. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. v. Marr,
  C.C.A.Okl., 98 F.2d 973, 975. The word "accident",
  requiring operator of vehicle to stop immediately in case
  of accident, contemplates any situation occurring on the
  highway wherein driver so operates his automobile as to
  cause injury to the property or person of another using
  the same highway. See also Hit and run accident.
  Insurance contract.   An accident within accident insur­
  ance policies is an event happening without any human
  agency, or, if happening through such agency, an event
  which, under circumstances, is unusual and not expect­
  ed by the person to whom it happens. A more compre­
  hensive term than "negligence," and in its common
  signification the word means an unexpected happening
  without intention or design.
  Maritime law.    "Accidents of navigation" or "accidents
  of the sea" are such as are peculiar to the sea or to usual
  navigation or the action of the elements, which do not

  and skill. The G. R. Booth, 171 U.S. 450, 19 S.Ct. 9, 43
  L.Ed. 234. See also Perils of the sea.
  Unavoidable accident. One which is not occasioned in
  any degree, either directly or remotely, by the want of
  such care and prudence as the law holds every man
  bound to exercise. Vincent v. Johnson, Tex.Civ.App.,
  117 S.W.2d 135. One which could not have been pre­

  Accomenda lrekamenda/. In maritime law, a contract
  between the owner of goods and the master of a ship, by
  which the former intrusts the property to the latter to
  be sold by him on their joint account. In such case, two
  contracts take place: First, the contract called manda­
  tum, by which the owner of the property gives the
  master power to dispose of it; and the contract of
  partnership, in virtue of which the profits are to be
  divided between them. One party runs the risk of losing
  his capital; the other, his labor. If the sale produces no
  more than first cost, the owner takes all the proceeds.
  It is only the profits which are to be divided.
  Accommodated party. One to whom the credit of the
  accommodation party is loaned, and is not necessarily
  the payee, since the inquiry always is as to whom did
  the maker of the paper loan his credit as a matter of

  also Accommodation party.

  engagement made as a favor to another, not upon a
  consideration received.     Something done to oblige,
  usually spoken of a loan of money or commercial paper;
  also a friendly agreement or composition of differences.
  The word implies no consideration. While a party's
  intent may be to aid a maker of note by lending his
  credit, if he seeks to accomplish thereby legitimate ob­
  jects of his own, and not simply to aid maker, the act is
  not for accommodation. See Accommodation maker.

  per.

  is one to which the accommodating party, be he accep­
  tor, drawer, or indorser, has put his name, without
consideration, for the purpose of benefiting or accommo­ 
dating some other party who desires to raise money on 
it, and is to provide for the bill when due. Hickox v. 
Hickox, Tex.Civ.App., 151 S.W.2d 913, 917. Such must

 exercises supervision over the driver; an unlicensed

 
 driver is not accompanied by a licensed driver unless th�

 latter is near enough to render advice and assistance.

Accomplice /;}k6mpl;}s/. One who knowingly, voluntar­

 § 2.06(3). One who is in some way concerned or associ­ 
 ated in commission of crime; partaker of guilt; one who

 complicity in crime charged, either by being present and 
 aiding or abetting in it, or having advised and encour­ 
 aged it, though absent from place when it was commit­ 
 ted, though mere presence, acquiescence, or silence, in 
 the absence of a duty to act, is not enough, no matter 
 how reprehensible it may be, to constitute one an accom­ 
 plice. One is liable as an accomplice to the crime of 
 another if he gave assistance or encouragement or failed 
 to perform a legal duty to prevent it with the intent

Accomplice liability. Criminal responsibility of one

  whom has a right of action against the other, to settle
  the dispute. In a debtor/creditor relationship, an agree­
  ment between the parties to settle a dispute for some
  partial payment. It is called an accord because the
  creditor has a right of action against the debtor.
  A satisfaction agreed upon between the party injuring
  and the party injured which, when performed, is a bar
  to all actions upon this account. An accord being a
  contract, the requirements of mutual assent and consid­
  eration must be met. Buob v. Feenaughty Machinery
  Co., 191 Wash. 477, 71 P.2d 559, 564. An agreement
  whereby one of parties undertakes to give or perform,
  and other to accept, in satisfaction of liquidated or
  disputed claim arising i��ither contract or tort some­
  thing different or less ,rry:
                           m what he is or considers
  himself entitled to; and satisfaction" is execution or
                          •
  performance of agreement. Harris, Upham & Co., Inc.
  v. Ballantyne, Tex.Civ.App., 538 S.W.2d 153, 158. It
  may arise both where the demand itself is unliquidated
  or in dispute, and where the amount and nature of the
  demand is undisputed, and it is agreed to give and take
  less than the demand. See Accord and satisfaction;
  Compromise and settlement; Executory accord; Satisfac­
  tion.

  Accord and satisfaction. A method of discharging a
  claim whereby the parties agree to give and accept
  something in settlement of the claim and perform the
  agreement, the "accord" being the agreement and the
  "satisfaction" its execution or performance, and it is a
  new contract substituted for an old contract which is
  thereby discharged, or for an obligation or cause of
  action which is settled, and must have all of the ele­
  ments of a valid contract. Holm v. Hansen, Iowa, 248
  N.W.2d 503, 506. An executory bilateral contract of
  "accord" is an agreement embodying a promise, express
  or implied, to accept at some future time a stipulated
  performance in satisfaction or discharge in whole or in
  part of any present claim, cause of action or obligation,
  and a promise express or implied to render such per­
  formance. Such arises where parties, by a subsequent
  agreement, have satisfied the former one, and the latter
  agreement has been executed. The execution of a new
  agreement may itself amount to a satisfaction, where it
  is so expressly agreed by the parties; and without such
  agreement, if the new promise is founded on a new
  consideration, in which case the taking of the new
  consideration amounts to the satisfaction of the former
  contract.
  Accord and satisfaction may also arise in a criminal
  case. See e.g. Mass.Gen.L. c. 276, § 55.
  In some jurisdictions, novation is a species of accord
  and satisfaction.

  stallment sales, recognition of income on construction
  projects (i.e., the completed-contract and percentage-of­
  completion methods), and the valuation of inventories
  (i.e. last-in first-out and first-in first-out). The various
  types of accounting methods appear below:
  Accrual method.      A method of keeping accounts which
  shows expenses incurred and income earned for a given
  period, although such expenses and income may not
  have been actually paid or received. Right to receive
  and not the actual receipt determines inclusion of
  amount in gross income. When right to receive an
  amount becomes fixed, right accrues. Obligations pay­
  able to or by taxpayer are treated as if discharged when
  incurred.     H. Liebes & Co. v. Commissioner of Internal
  Revenue, C.C.A.9, 90 F.2d 932, 936. Entries are made of
  credits and debits when liability arises, whether re­
  ceived or disbursed. Insurance Finance Corporation v.
  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.A.3, 84 F.2d 382.
  See also Accrual basis; Accrue (Taxation).
  Cash method. The practice of recording income and
  expense only when cash is received or paid out; used in
  contradistinction to accrual method.            See Cash basis
f accounts, who are employed for the             accounting.
  Completed contract method. A method of reporting prof­
  it or loss on certain long-term contracts. Under this
  method of accounting, gross income and expenses are
  recognized in the tax year in which the contract is
  completed. This method should be used only when the
  conditions or terms of the contract do not permit use of
  the percent of completion method.
  Cost method.     The practice of recording the value of
  assets in terms of their cost.          See also Cost (Cost ac­
  counting).
  Fair value method.    Valuation of assets at present val­
  ue, meaning same as actual value or market value.

Accounting for profits.       Action for equitable relief 
 against one in a fiduciary relation to recover profits 
 taken in breach of relation.
Accounting period. The period of time, usually a year, 
 used by a taxpayer in the determination of income and 
 related tax liability. Unless a fiscal year is chosen, 
 taxpayers must determine and pay their income tax
 liability by using the calendar year (i.e., January 1

 through December 31) as the period of measurement.

 An example of a fiscal year is July 1 through June 30.

 A change in accounting periods (e.g. , from a calendar

 year to a fiscal year) generally requires the consent of

 
 such as a newly formed corporation, are free to select 
 either an initial calendar or a fiscal year without the 
 consent of the Internal

 send with credentials as an envoy. This latter use is 
 
  Accredited law school.    Law school which has been
  approved by the state and the Association of American
  Law Schools and/or the American Bar Association. In
  certain states (e.g. Calif.) a law school might be accredit­
  ed by the state, but not by either the AALS or ABA.      In
  most states only graduates of AALS or ABA accredited
  law schools are permitted to take the state bar exam.
  Accredited representative.        As respects service of pro­
  cess, representative having general authority to act.

  Land. Addition of portions of soil, by gradual deposition
  through the operation of natural causes, to that already
  in possession of owner. Willett v. Miller, 176 Okl. 278,
  55 P.2d 90, 92. Accretion of land is of two kinds: By
  alluvion, i.e., by the washing up of sand or soil, so as to
  form firm ground; or by dereliction, as when the sea
  shrinks below the usual water-mark. The term "allu­
  vion" is applied to deposit itself, while "accretion" de­
  notes the act.      However, the terms are frequently used
  synonymously. Land uncovered by gradual subsidence
  of water is not an "accretion" but a "reliction".

  Accrual basis.   A method of accounting that reflects
  expenses incurred and income earned for any one tax
  year. In contrast to the cash basis of accounting, ex­
  penses do not have to be paid to be deductible nor does
  income have to be received to be taxable. Unearned
  income (e. g., prepaid interest and rent) generally is
  taxed in the year of receipt regardless of the method of
  accounting used by the taxpayer. See Accounting.

 deliberate act, intended to renew and ratify a transac­ 
 tion known to be voidable. De Boe v. Prentice Packing

 waive or abandon his right. Yench v. Stockmar, C.A.

 
   It is to be distinguished from avowed consent, on the

Acquiescence and laches are cognate but not equivalent 
 terms. The former is a submission to, or resting satis­ 
 fied with, an existing state of things, while laches im­ 
 plies a neglect to do that which the party ought to do for 
 his own ben
 evidence of acquiescence. Laches imports a merely pas­ 
 sive assent, while acquiescence implies active assent. In

 escence" relates to inaction during performance of an 
 act while "laches" relates to delay after act is done. 
 
 
Administrative agencies.   An administrative agency's 
 policy of agreeing to be bound by judicial precedent 
 which is contrary to the agency's interpretation of its 
 
Acquiesc
 of estoppel. An estoppel arises where party aware of his 
 rights sees other party acting upon mistaken notion of 
 his rights. Injury accruing from one's acquiescence in 
  See     another's action to his prejudice creates "estoppel". Le­
  bold v. Inland Steel Co., C.C.A.Ill., 125 F.2d 369, 375.
  Passive conduct on the part of one who has knowledge of
  the facts may be basis of estoppel. Winslow v. Burns, 47
  N.M. 29, 132 P.2d 1048, 1050. It must appear that party
  to be estopped was bound in equity and good conscience
  to speak and that party claiming estoppel relied upon
  acquiescence and was misled thereby to change his posi­
  tion to his prejudice. Sherlock v. Greaves, 106 Mont.
  206, 76 P.2d 87, 91. See also Estoppel.

  Commissioner of Insurance v. Broad Street Mut. Casual­
  ty Ins. Co., 312 Mass. 261, 44 N.E.2d 683, 684. The act
  of getting or obtaining something which may be already
  in existence, or may be brought into existence through
  means employed to acquire it. Ronnow v. City of Las
  Vegas, 57 Nev. 332, 65 P.2d 133, 140. Sometimes used
  in the sens� of "procure." It does not necessarily mean
  that title has passed. Includes taking by devise. U. S.

  quires or procures the property in anything. State ex

  act of law in the cases of forfeiture, succession, mar­
  riage, judgment, insolvency, and intestacy; or by act of
  the parties, as by gift or sale.
  Original acquisition is that by which a man secures a
  property in a thing which is not at the time he acquires
  it, and in its then existing condition, the property of any
  other individual. It may result from occupancy; acces­
  sion; intellectual labor-namely, for inventions, which
  are secured by patent rights; and for the authorship of

 innocence of a person who has been charged with crime; 
 a deliverance or setting free a person from a charge of 
 guilt; finding of not guilty. Also, one legally acquitted 
 by a judgment rendered otherwise than in pursuance of 
 a verdict, as where he is discharged by a magistrate 
 because of the 
 indictment is dismissed by the court or a nol. pros. 
 entered. Or, it may occur even though the question of 
 guilt or innocence has never been submitted to a jury, as 
 where a defendant, having been held under an indict­ 
 ment or information, is discharged because not brought 
 
  Acquittals in fact are those which take place when the 
 
  Acquittals in law are those which take place by mere

  operation of law; as where a man has been charged

  merely as an accessory, and the principal has been

  acquitted.

  Act, n. Denotes external manifestation of actor's wilL
  Restatement, Second, Torts § 2. Expression of will or
  purpose, carrying idea of performance; primarily that
  which is done or doing; exercise of power, or effect of
  which power exerted is cause; a performance; a deed.
  In its most general sense, this noun signifies something
  done voluntarily by a person; the exercise of an individ­
  ual's power; an effect produced in the external world by
  an exercise of the power of a person objectively, prompt­
  ed by intention, and proximately caused by a motion of
  the will. In a more technical sense, it means something
  done voluntarily by a person, and of such a nature that
  certain legal consequences attach to it. Thus a grantor
  acknowledges the conveyance to be his "act and deed,"
  the terms being synonymous. It may denote something
  done by an individual, as a private citizen, or as an
  officer; or by a body of men, as a legislature, a council,
  or a court of justice; including not merely physical acts,
  but also decrees, edicts, laws, judgments, resolves,
  awards, and determinations. Some general laws made
  by the Congress of the United States are styled joint
  resolutions, and these have the same force and effect as
  those styled acts.
  Acts under private signature are those which have been
  made by private individuals under their hands.
  Criminal act. External manifestation of one's will
  which is prerequisite to criminal responsibility. There
  can be no crime without some act, affirmative or nega­
  tive. An omission or failure to act may constitute an
  act for purpose of criminal law.
  Legislative act. An alternative name for statutory law.
  A bill which has been enacted by legislature into law.
  When introduced into the first house of the legislature,
  a piece of proposed legislation is known as a bill. When
  passed to the next house, it may then be referred to as
  an act. After enactment the terms "law" and "act" may
  be used interchangeably. An act has the same legisla­
  tive force as a joint resolution but is technically distin­
  guishable, being of a different form and introduced with
  the words "Be it enacted" instead of "Be it resolved."
  Acts are either public or private. Public acts (also
  called general acts, or general statutes, or statutes at
 large) are those which relate to the community general­ 
 ly, or establish a universal rule for the governance of 
 the whole body politic. Private acts (formerly called 
 special), are those which relate either to particular per­ 
 sons (personal acts) or to particular places (local acts), or 
 which operate only upon specified individuals or their 
 private concerns. Unity v. Burrage, 103 U.S. 447, 454, 
 26 L.Ed. 465. Public acts are those which concern the

 whole community and of which courts of law are bound 
 
    A "special" or "private" act is one operating only on

 particular persons and private concerns. A "local act"

 is one applicable oniy to a particular part of the legisla­ 
 
   See also Governmental act; Legislation; Legislative act; 
 
 Private acts are those made by private persons as reg­

 isters in relation to their receipts and expenditures,

 schedules, acquittances, and the like.
 Public acts are those which have a public authority, and

 which have been made before public officers, are autho­

 rized by a public seal, have been made public by the

 authority of a magistrate, or which have been extracted

 and been properly authenticated from public records.

  most state courts, there is only one form of action-civil
  action-which embraces all actions formerly denom­

  purposes, substantive principles of equity still govern.

  Common law actions are such as will lie, on the partic­
  ular facts, at common law, without the aid of a statute.
  Actions are called, in common-law practice, ex contrac­
  tu when they arise out of a contract, and ex delicto
  when they arise out of a tort. If a cause of action
  arises from a breach of promise, the action is "ex
  contractu", and, if it arises from breach of duty grow­
  ing out of contract, it is "ex delicto".
  Criminal actions are such as are instituted by the
  sovereign power (i.e. government), for the purpose of
  punishing or preventing offenses against the public.

 al, state, or local authorities or by an individual under 
 permission of a statute, to enforce a penalty imposed by 
 law for the commission of a prohibited act. See Crimi­ 
 
 Personal action.    In civil law, an action in personam 
 seeks to enforce an obligation imposed on the defen­ 
 dant by his contract or delict; that is, it is the conten­ 
 tion that he is bound to transfer some dominion or to 
 perform some service or to repair some loss. In com­ 
 mon law, an action brought for the recovery of some 
 debt or for damages for some personal injury, in contra­ 
 distinction to the old real actions, which related to real 
 property only. An action which can be brought only by 
 
 
 Popular actions,
 which were given upon the breach of a penal statute, 
 and which any man that will may sue on account of the 
 king and himself, as the statute allowed and the case 
 
 especially, but generally to any that would prosecute, it 
 was called "action popular;" and, from the words used 
 in the process (qui tam pro domino rege sequitur quam 
 pro se ipso, who sues as well for the king as for himself)

 specific recovery of lands, tenements, or hereditaments. 
 They are droitural when they are based upon the right

 
 of property, and possessory when based upon the right 
 of possession. They are either writs of right; writs of

 entry upon disseisin (which lie in the per, the per et

 cui, or the post), intrusion, or alienation; writs ances­

 tral possessory, as mort d'ancestor, aiel, besaiel, cossi­ 
 nage, or nuper obiit. The former class was divided into 
 droitural, founde
 ancestral droitural upon the demandant's claim in re­ 
 spect of a mere right descended to him from an ances­ 
 
 way-as to the demandant's own seisin and as to that

 the particular statutes creating them. Contrast Com­ 
 
 Transitory actions are those founded upon a cause of 
 action not necessarily referring to or arising in any 
 particular locality. Their characteristic feature is that 
 the right of action follows the person of the defendant. 
  Actions are "transitory" when the transactions relied
  on might have taken place anywhere, and are "local"
  when they could not occur except in some particular
  place; the distinction being in the nature of the subject
  of the injury, and not in the means used or the place at
  which the cause of action arises. The test of whether
  an action is local or transitory is whether the injury is
  done to a subject-matter which, in its nature, could not
  arise beyond the locality of its situation, in contradis­
  tinction to the subject causing the injury. Actions
  triable where defendant resides are termed "trans­
  itory" and those triable where the subject-matter is
  situated are termed "local."
  Actionable. That for which an action will lie, furnish­
  ing legal ground for an action. See Cause of action;
  Justiciable controversy.
  Actionable fraud. Deception practiced in order to in­
  duce another to part with property or surrender some
  legal right. A false representation made with an inten­
  tion to deceive; such may be committed by stating what
  is known to be false or by professing knowledge of the
  truth of a statement which is false, but in either case,
  the essential ingredient is a falsehood uttered with in­
  tent to deceive. To constitute "actionable fraud," it
  must appear that defendant made a material represen­
  tation; that it was false; that when he made it he knew
  it was false, or made it recklessly without any knowl­
  edge of its truth and as a positive assertion; that he
  made it with intention that it should be acted on by
  plaintiff; that plaintiff acted in reliance on it; and that
  plaintiff thereby suffered injury. Vertes V. GAC Proper­
  ties, Inc., D.C.Fla., 337 F.Supp. 256, 266. Essential ele­
  ments are representation, falsity, scienter, deception,
  reliance and injury. See Fraud.
  Actionable misrepresentation. A false statement re­
  specting a fact material to the contract and which is
  influential in procuring it. See Fraud; Misrepresenta­
  tion.
  Actionable negligence. The breach or nonperformance
  of a legal duty, through neglect or carelessness, result­
  ing in damage or injury to another. It is failure of duty,
  omission of something which ought to have been done,
  or doing of something which ought not to have been
  done, or which reasonable man, guided by considerations
  which ordinarily regulate conduct of human affairs,
  would or would not do. Essential elements are failure
  to exercise due care, injury, or damage, and proximate
  cause. See Negligence.
  Actionable nuisance. Anything wrongfully done or
  permitted which injures or annoys another in the enjoy­
  ment of his legal rights. Miller V. City of Dayton, 70
  Ohio App. 173, 41 N.E.2d 728, 730. Anything injurious
  to health, or indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an
  obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere
  with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property. See
  Nuisance.
  Actionable per quod. Words actionable only on allega­
  tion and proof of special damage. Knapp V. Post Print­
  ing & Publishing Co., 111 Colo. 492, 144 P.2d 981, 984.
 Words not actionable per se upon their face, but only in 
 consequence of extrinsic facts showing circumstances 
 under which they were said or the damages resulting to

 slandered party therefrom. Not injurious on their face

 in their usual and natural signification, but only so in

 consequence of extrinsic facts and requiring innuendo.

See Libelous per quod.
Actionable per see Words in themselves libelous or
 slanderous. Knapp v. Post Printing & Publishing Co.,

  Action of writ. A (now obsolete) phrase in common law
  pleading used when a defendant plead some matter by

  entitled to another writ or action for the same matter.
  Actio non Irekshiyow non/. In the common law plead­
  ing, the Latin name of that part of a special plea which

Action on the case. A common law species of personal 
 action of formerly extensive application, otherwise 
 called "trespass on the case," or simply "case," from the 
 circumstance of 
 complaint being set forth at length in the original writ 
 
 most comprehensive signification it includes assumpsit 
 as well as an action in form ex delicto ; though when it 
 is mentioned it is usually understood to mean an action 
 in form ex delicto. It is founded on the common law or 
 upon acts of Parliament, and lies generally to recover 
 damages for torts not committed with force, actual or 
 implied; or having been occasioned by force where the 
 matter affected was not 
 immediate but consequential; or where the interest in 
 the property was only in reversion, in all of which cases 
 trespass is not sustainable. In the progress of judicial 
 contestation it was discovered that there was a mass of 
 tortious wrongs unattended by direct and immediate

 force, or where the force, though direct, was not expend­

 ed on an existing right of present enjoyment, for which

 the then known forms of action furnished no redress.

 The action on the case was instituted to meet this want. 
 And wrongs which will maintain an action on the case 
 
 duties, which are but the implication of contract obli­ 
 gation, duties of requisite skill, fidelity, diligence, and a

 proper regard for the rights of others, implied in every

 obligation to serve another. If the cause of action arises

 from a breach of promise, the action is "ex contractu";

 but if the cause of action arises from a breach of duty

 growing out of the contract, it is in form ex delicto and

 case. When there is a contract, either express or im­

 plied, from which a common-law duty results, an action

 on the case lies for the breach of that duty. Such form

 of action no longer exists under Code and Rule pleading. 
 
Actio non ulterius lrekshiyow non ;}ltiriy;s/. In English

  Action to quiet title. One in which plaintiff asserts his
  own estate and declares generally that defendant claims
  some estate in the land, without defining it, and avers
  that the claim is without foundation, and calls on defen­
  dant to set forth the nature of his claim, so that it may
  be determined by decree. It differs from a "suit to
  remove a cloud," in that plaintiff therein declares on his
  own title, and also avers the source and nature of
  defendant's claim, points out its defect, and prays that it
  may be declared void as a cloud on plaintiffs estate. It
  embraces every sort of a claim whereby the plaintiff
  might be deprived of his property or his title clouded or
  its value depreciated, or whereby the plaintiff might be
  incommoded or damnified by assertion of an outstanding
  title already held or to grow out of the adverse preten­

  Actio prenalis I rekshiyow piyneyl;}s/. Called also actio
  ex delicto. An action in which a penalty was recovered
  of the delinquent.
  Actiones prenales and actiones mixtre comprehended
  cases of injuries, for which the civil law permitted re­
  dress by private action, but which modern civilization
  universally regards as crimes; that is, offenses against
  society at large, and punished by proceedings in the
  name of the state alone. Thus, theft, receiving stolen
  goods, robbery, malicious mischief, and the murder or
  negligent homicide of a slave (in which case an injury to
  property was involved), gave rise to private actions for
  damages against the delinquent.

Actio prrescriptis verbis lrekshiyow pr�skript�s v�rb�s/. 
 A form of action which derived its force from continued 
 usage or the responsa prudentium, and was founded on 
 the unwritten law. The distinction 
 and an actio in factum is said to be, that the latter was 
 
 analogy to or on the equity of some subsisting law.

Actio prretoria lrekshiyow pr�toriy;}/. A prretorian ac­ 
 tion; one introduced by the prretor, as distinguished 
 from the more ancient actio civilis (q. v.).

  beneficial action or equitable action. An action founded
  on equity instead of strict law, and available for those
  who had equitable rights or the beneficial ownership of
  property. Actions are divided into actiones directre or
  utiles. The former are founded on certain legal obli­
  gations which from their origin were accurately defined
  and recognized as actionable. The latter were formed
  analogically in imitation of the former. They were
  permitted in legal obligations for which the actiones
  directre were not originally intended, but which resem­
  bled the legal obligations which formed the basis of the
  direct action.
  Actio venditi 1 rekshiyow vend;}tayI. An action em­

  species of mixed action, which lay for a party whose

  subsisting; the opposite of passive. An active debt is
  one which draws interest. An active trust is a confi­
  dence connected with a duty. An active use is a present
  legal estate.
  Active concealment. Term implies a purpose or design
  to conceal accomplished by words or acts, while passive
concealment consists in mere silence where there is a 
duty to speak.        Vendt v. Duenke, Mo.App., 210 S.W.2d

692, 699.       Concealment becomes a fraud where it is

effected by misleading and deceptive talk, acts, or con­

duct, where it is accompanied by misrepresentations, or

where, in addition to a party's silence, there is any

statement, word, or act on his part which tends affirma­

tively to a suppression of the truth. Such conduct is

designated active concealment. Equitable Life Ins. Co.

bracing many occurrences that would fall short of will­ 
ful wrongdoing, or of crass negligence, for example, all 
inadvertent acts causing injury to others, resulting from 
 failure to exercise ordinary care; likewise, all acts the 
effects of which are misjudged or unforeseen, through 
want of proper attention, or reflection, and hence the

those which are not of that character. Cohen v. Noel,

  Active negligence denotes some positive act or some

failure in duty of operation which is equivalent of a

positive act and is omission of due care and affirmative

action by person in control, or negligence occurring in

connection with activities conducted on the premises. 
Pachowitz v. Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Corp.,
 56 Wis.2d 383, 202 N.W.2d 268, 275. Difference between

 "active" and "passive" negligence is that one is only

 passively negligent if he merely fails to act in fulfill­

 ment of duty of care which law imposes upon him, while

 one is actively negligent if he participates in some

 manner in conduct or omission which caused injury.

Act of bankruptcy. Term used under former federal
 Bankruptcy Act (§ 3), to refer to any act which rendered

 a person liable to be proceeded against involuntarily as

 a bankrupt, or for which he could be adjudged bankrupt.

 untary bankruptcy when the debtor, in general, is not 
 paying his debts as they become due. Bankruptcy Code,

  Act of God.  An act occasioned exclusively by forces of
  nature without the interference of any human agency.
  A misadventure or casualty is said to be caused by the
  "act of God," when it happens by the direct, immediate,
  and exclusive operation of the forces of nature, uncon­
  trolled and uninfluenced by the power of man, and
  without human intervention, and is of such a character
  that it could not have been prevented or escaped from
  by any amount of foresight or prudence, or by any
  reasonable degree of care or diligence, or by the aid of
  any appliances which the situation of the party might
  reasonably require him to use. Any accident produced
  by any physical cause which is irresistible, such as
  lightning, tempests, perils of the seas, tornados, earth­
  quakes. Middaugh v. U.S., D.C.Wyo., 293 F.Supp. 977,

  ment.    See Act in pais.

  of parliament form the leges scriptre, i.e., the written
  laws of the kingdom. Such acts are of three kinds:
  public, local or special, private or personal. The validity
  of a statute cannot be questioned in court.
  Act of providence. An accident against which ordinary
  skill and foresight could not guard.       Equivalent to "act

Actor.   One who acts.    The term is used in the Restate­

 ment of Torts, Second, to designate either the person 
 whose conduct is in question as subjecting him to liabili­ 
 ty toward another, or as precluding him from recovering 
 against another whose tortious conduct is a legal cause 
 
 
 pleader; one who acted for another in legal matters; 
 one who represented a party and managed his cause. 
 An attorney, bailiff, or steward; one who managed or

 acted for another.      The Scotch "doer" is the literal 
 
 Roman law.      One who acted for another;       one who 
 attended to another's business; a manager or agent. 
 slave who attended to, transacted, or superintended his 
 master's business or affairs, received and paid out mon­ 
 eys, and kept accounts.      The word has a variety of 
 closely-related meanings
 with manager.    Thus, actor dominre, manager of his 
 master's farm; actor ecclesile, manager of church proper- 
  ty; actores provinciarum, tax-gatherers, treasurers, and
  managers of the public debt.
  Actor ecclesile.-An advocate for a church; one who
  protects the temporal interests of a church. Actor
  villre was the steward or head-bailiff of a town or
  village.
  Plaintiff or complainant.      In a civil or private action
  the plaintiff was often called by the Romans "petitor;"
  in a public action (causa publica) he was called "accusa­
  tor. " The defendant was called "reus, " both in private
  and public causes. This term, however, might signify
  either party, as might be concluded from the word
  itself. In a private action, the defendant was often
  called "adversarius, " but either party might be called
  so.
  Also, the term is used of a party who, for the time
  being, sustains the burden of proof, or has the initiative
  in the suit.
  Actore non probante reus absolvitur Irektoriy non
  prowbrentiy riy;)s rebzolv;)t;)r/.   When the plaintiff does
  not prove his case the defendant is acquitted (or ab­
  solved).
  Actori incumbit onus probandi Irektoray il)k;}mb;)t
  own;)s pr;)brendayI. The burden of proof rests on the
  plaintiff (or on the party who advances a proposition
  affirmatively.)
  Actor qui contra regulam quid adduxit, non est au­
  diendus lrektor kwity kontr;) regy;)l;)m kwid ;)d;}ks;)t,
  non est odiyend;)s/. A plaintiff (or pleader) is not to be
  heard who has advanced anything against authority (or
  against the rule).
  Actor sequitur forum rei Irektor sekw;)t;)r for;)m riyayI.
  According as rei is intended as the genitive of res, a
  thing, or reus, a defendant, this phrase means: The
  plaintiff follows the forum of the property in suit, or the
  forum of the defendant's residence.

 work.    Nissen v. Miller, 44 N.M. 487, 105 P.2d 324, 326.

A
 dence would himself take under similar circumstances

Adequate cause. Sufficient cause for a particular pur­ 
 
   In criminal law, adequate cause for the passion which 
 reduces a homicide committed under its influence from 
 the grade of murder to manslaughter, means such cause 
  as would commonly produce a degree of anger, rage,
  resentment, or terror, in a person of ordinary temper,
  sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection.
  Insulting words or gestures, or an assault and battery so
  slight as to show no intention to inflict pain or injury, or
  an injury to property unaccompanied by violence are not
  adequate causes. Berry v. State, 143 Tex.Cr.R. 67, 157
  S.W.2d 650, 652. See Adequate provocation; Cause;
  Probable cause.
  Adequate compensation. Just value of property taken
  under power of eminent domain, payable in money, as
  guaranteed by 5th Amendment. Market value of prop­
  erty when taken. It may include interest and may
  include the cost or value of the property to the owner for
  the purposes for which he designed it.        Such only as
  puts injured party in as good a condition as he would
  have been in if injury had not been inflicted.     Town of
  Winchester v. Cox, 129 Conn. 106, 26 A.2d 592, 597. See
  also Fair market value; Just compensation.
  Adequate consideration.    Such as is equal, or reason­
  ably proportioned, to the value of that for which it is
  given. That which is not so disproportionate as to shock
  our sense of that morality and fair dealing which should
  always characterize transactions between man and man.
  Fair and reasonable under circumstances.      Reasonably
  just and equitable. See Consideration; Fair consideration;
  Fair market value; Fair value; Just compensation.
  Adequate notice.     Notice reasonably calculated to ap­
  prise a person of an action, proceeding, or motion. N0-
  tice sufficient to permit an objection or defense. U. S. v.
  San Juan Lumber Co., D.C.Colo., 313 F.Supp. 703, 709.
  Notice reasonably calculated, in all circumstances of
  given proceeding, to apprise all interested parties of
  action and opportunity to present their objections. U.S.
  v. San Juan Lumber Co., D.C.Colo., 313 F.Supp. 703, 709.
  See Notice.

  with accused, interviews with witnesses, study of facts
  and law, and determination of character of defense to be
  made and policy to be followed during trial. Nelson v.
  Dillender      Commonwealth, 295 Ky. 641, 175 S.W.2d 132, 133.
  Adequate protection.   Phrase used in several sections
  of the Bankruptcy Code to describe protection afforded
  to holders of secured claims. It is meant to preserve
  secured creditor's position at the time of bankruptcy. In
  re Jamaica House, Inc., Bkrtcy.Vt., 31 B.R. 192, 195.
  More specifically, the lack of adequate protection of the
  creditor's interest in its collateral is a basis for relief
  from stay under Code § 362(d)(1); adequate protection is
  also the standard for creditor protection from sale or use
  or encumbrance of the collateral under Code sections
  363 and 364. While adequate protection is not statutori­
  ly defined, section 361 sets out examples of adequate
  protection. See In re Cooley, Bkrtcy.Pa., 37 B.R. 590,
  592.
  Adequate provocation.      An adequate provocation to
  cause a sudden transport of passion that may suspend
  the exercise of judgment and exclude premeditation and
  a previously formed design is one that is calculated to
 excite such anger as might obscure the reason or domi­ 
 nate the volition of an ordinary reasonable man. See 
 Adequate cause.
Adequat
 litigant who fails to avail himself of a remedy provided 
 by law and who is subsequently barred from pursuing 
 that remedy because of his own lack of diligence cannot

 rely on the absence of a remedy at law as a basis for 
 equitable jurisdiction, is one which is as complete, prac­ 
 tical and as efficient to the ends of justice and its 
 prompt administration as a remedy in equity, and which 
 is obtainable as of right.    In re Wife, K., Del.Ch., 297 
 
    As preventing relief by injunction, means a remedy 
 which is plain and complete and as practical and effi­

 cient to ends of justice and its prompt administration as

 a remedy in equity, and although an injunction will

 issue when legal remedy is inadequate, injunction
 should not be granted where complainant has an ade­ 
 quate remedy at law. 
 App., 350 S.W.2d 955, 957.
   A remedy that affords complete relief with reference

 to the particular matter in controversy, and is appropri­

 ate to the circumstances of the case. Such must reach

 end intended, and actually compel performance of duty

 in question. Simpson v. Williams Rural High School

 Dist., Tex.Civ.App., 153 S.W.2d 852, 856.

  Adhering.  Joining, leagued with, cleaving to; as,
  "adhering to the enemies of the United States."
  "Adhering" consists in giving to the United States the
  loyalty due from a citizen. United States v. Stephan,
  D.C.Mich., 50 F.Supp. 738, 741. Any intentional act
  furthering hostile designs of enemies of the United
  States, or an act which intentionally strengthens or
  tends to strengthen enemies of the United States, or
  which weakens or tends to weaken power of the United
  States to resist and attack such enemies, constitutes
  "adhering" to such enemies.      United States v. Haupt,
  D.C.Ill., 47 F.Supp. 836, 839.
  Adhesion.    Agreement to join; adherence. The en­
  trance of another nation into an existing treaty with
  respect only to a part of the principles laid down or the
  stipUlations agreed to. Properly speaking, by adhesion
  the third nation becomes a party only to such parts as
  To         are specifically agreed to, and by accession it accepts
  and is bound by the whole treaty.     See Accession.
  Adhesion contract. Standardized contract form offered
  to consumers of goods and services on essentially "take
  it or leave it" basis without affording consumer realistic
  opportunity to bargain and under such conditions that
  consumer cannot obtain desired product or services ex­
  cept by acquiescing in form contract.     Distinctive fea­
  ture of adhesion contract is that weaker party has no
  realistic choice as to its terms. Cubic Corp. v. Marty, 4
  Dist., 185 C.A.3d 438, 229 Cal.Rptr. 828, 833; Standard
  Oil Co. of Calif. v. Perkins, C.A.Or., 347 F.2d 379, 383.
  Recognizing that these contracts are not the result of
  traditionally "bargained" contracts, the trend is to re­
  lieve parties from onerous conditions imposed by such
  contracts. However, not every such contract is uncon­
  scionable. Lechmere Tire and Sales Co. v. Burwick, 360
  Mass. 713, 720, 721, 277 N.E.2d 503.

 set upon things stolen or lost, as a recompense to the 
 owner.
Adjacent.  Lying near or close to; sometimes, contig­ 
 uous; neighboring. Adjacent implies that the two ob- 
  jects are not widely separated, though they may not
  actually touch, Harrison v. Guilford County, 218 N.C.
  718, 12 S.E.2d 269, while adjoining imports that they

  intervenes.   Wolfe v. Hurley, D.C.La., 46 F.2d 515, 521 .
  See Adjoining.
  Adjective law.  The aggregate of rules of procedure or
  practice. Also called adjectival law, as opposed to that
  body of law which the courts are established to adminis­
  ter (called "substantive law"), it means the rules accord­
  ing to which the substantive law is administered; e.g.
  Rules of Civil Procedure. That part of the law which
  provides a method for enforcing or maintaining rights,
  or obtaining redress for their invasion. Maurizi v. West­
  ern Coal & Mining Co., 321 Mo. 378, 11 S.W.2d 268, 272.
  Pertains to and prescribes practice, method, procedure
  or legal machinery by which substantive law is enforced
  or made effective. Ambrose v. State Dept. of Public
  Health and Welfare, Mo.App., 319 S.W.2d 271, 274. See
  also Procedural law, Compare Substantive law.
  From    Adjoining.   The word in its etymological sense means
  touching or contiguous, as distinguished from lying near
  to or adjacent. To be in contact with; to abut upon.
  State ex reI. Boynton v. Bunton, 141 Kan. 103, 40 P.2d
  326, 328. And the same meaning has been given to it
  when used in statutes. See Adjacent.
  Adjoining owners. Those persons who own land touch­
  ing the subject land and who, as a result, have right to
  notice of proceedings concerning the subject real estate
  as, for example, in zoning and licensing matters.   Bay­
  port Civic Ass'n v. Koehler, Sup., 138 N.Y.S.2d 524, 530.
  See Abutting owner.
  Adjourn I �j�rn/ .To put off; defer; recess; postpone.

Ad colligendum bona defuneti.      To collect the goods of 
the deceased.   Special letters of administration granted

p

a
Ancillary administration is auxiliary and subordinate to

  with administering and implementing particular legisla­
  tion.  Examples are worker's compensation commis­
  sions, Federal Trade Commission, Hastings Mfg. Co. v.

  certiorari denied 328 U.S. 853, 66 S.Ct. 1344, 90 L.Ed.
  1626; tax commissions, First State Bank of Mountainair
  v. State Tax Commission, 40 N.M. 319, 59 P.2d 667;
  public service commissions, New York Cent. R. Co. v.
  Public Service Commission, 212 Ind. 329, 7 N.E.2d 957;
  and the like.    In addition to "agency", such governmen­
  tal bodies may be called commissions, corporations (e.g.
  F.D.I.C.), boards, departments, or divisions.
  The term "agency" includes any department, indepen­
  dent establishment, commission, administration, author­
  ity, board or bureau of the United States or any corpora­

  Administrative board.        This term is very broad and
  includes bodies exercising varied functions, some of
  which involve orders made or other acts done ex parte
  or without full hearing as to the operative facts, while
  others are done only after such a notice and hearing,
  and the functions of the former kind are plainly "admin­
  istrative" and those of the latter are "quasi judiciaL"
  Beaverdale Memorial Park v. Danaher, 127 Conn. 175,
  15 A.2d 17, 21. Administrative boards differ from
  "courts" in that boards frequently represent public in­
  terests entrusted to boards, whereas courts are con­
  cerned with litigating rights of parties with adverse
  interests.   Rommell v. Walsh, 127 Conn. 16, 15 A.2d 6, 9.
  Administrative collateral estoppel.       Principles of this
  estoppel doctrine apply when agency is acting in a
  judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact
  properly before it which parties have had adequate
  opportunity to litigate; threshold inquiry is whether
  earlier proceeding is essential equivalent of judicial pro­
  ceeding.     City Wide Learning Center, Inc. v. William C.
  Smith & Co., Inc., D.C.App., 488 A.2d 1310, 1313.

 istrative provisions of a trust by the trustee acting alone 
 or with prior approval of the court.      Anderson v. Ry­ 
 
Administrative discretion.       Term means that the doing 
 of acts or things required to be done may rest, in part at 
 least, upon considerations not entirely susceptible of 
 proof or disproof and at times which considering the 
 circumstances and subject-matter cannot be supplied by 
 the Legislature, and a statute confers such discretion 
 when it refers a commission or office to beliefs, expecta­

 tions, or tendencies instead of facts for the exercise of 
 the powers conferred. Culver v. Smith, Tex.Civ.App., 74 
 
Administrative exhaustion.        See Exhaustion of adminis­

 
Administrative hearing.   An oral proceeding before an

  Adverse possession.       A method of acquisition of title to
  real property by possession for a statutory period under
  certain conditions. Lowery v. Garfield County, 122
  Mont. 571, 208 P.2d 478, 486. It has been described as
  the statutory method of acquiring title to land by limita­
  tion.   Field v. Sosby, Tex.Civ.App., 226 S.W.2d 484, 486.
  Because of the statute of limitations on the bringing of
  actions for the recovery of land, title can be acquired to
  real property by adverse possession. In order to estab­
  lish title in this manner, there must be proof of nonper­
  missive use which is actual, open, notorious, exclusive
  and adverse for the statutorily prescribed period. Ryan
  v. Stavros, 348 Mass. 251, 203 N.E.2d 85. State statutes
  differ with respect to the required length of possession
  from an upper limit of 20 years to a lower one of 5 years,
  with even more extreme time periods covering certain
  special cases. There may be different periods of time
  even within a single state, depending on whether or not
  the adverse possessor has color of title and/or whether
  or not taxes have been paid. In some cases a longer
  possession is required against public entities than
  against individuals.
  Adverse possession depends on intent of occupant to
  claim and hold real property in opposition to all the
  world, Sertic v. Roberts, 171 Or. 121, 136 P.2d 248; and
  also embodies the idea that owner of or persons interest­
  ed in property have knowledge of the assertion of owner­
  ship by the occupant, Field v. Sosby, Tex.Civ.App., 226
  S.W.2d 484, 486.
  Adverse possession consists of actual possession with
  intent to hold solely for possessor to exclusion of others
  and is denoted by exercise of acts of dominion over land
  including making of ordinary use and taking of ordinary
  profits of which land is susceptible in its present state.

  Adverse witness.        A witness who gives evidence on a
  material matter prejudicial to the party then examining
  him. Commonly used to describe a witness whose testi­
  mony is prejudicial or unfavorable to the party who
  called him and as a result, such witness may be im­
  peached. Foremost Dairies Inc. of South v. Cutler, Fla.
 App., 212 So.2d 37, 40, 41.      See also Adverse interest;

 the other. Kest v.- Lewis, 169 Ohio St. 317, 159 N.E.2d

 
   Degrees of relationship by affinity are computed as

 are degrees of relationship by consanguinity. The doc­

 trine of affinity grew out of the canonical maxim that

 marriage makes husband and wife one. The husband
 has the same relation, by affinity, to his wife's blood 
 relatives as she has to them by consanguinity and vice 
 
   Affinity is distinguished into three kinds: (1) Direct, 
 or that subsisting between the husband and his wife's 
 relations by blood, or between the wife and the hus­ 
 band's relations by blood; (2) secondary, or that which

 subsists between the husband and his wife's relations by 
 marriage; (3) collateral, or that which subsists between 
 the husband and the relations of his wife's relations. 
     In a larger sense, consanguinity or kindred.
 Quasi affinity. In the civil law, the affinity which exists 
 between two persons, one of whom has been betrothed to

 a kinsman of the other, but who have never been mar­

 ried.

 establish, reassert. To make af
 solemn and formal declaration or asseveration that an

 to give testimony on affirmation. See Affidavit; Jurat; 
 
 Judgment. In the practice of appellate courts, to affirm

 a judgment, decree, or order, is to declare that it is valid 
 and right and must stand as rendered below; to ratify 
 and reassert it; to concur in its correctness and confirm 
 its efficacy. If the appellate court remanded the case, it 
 would be sending it back to the lower court with instruc­ 
 tions to correct the irregularities specified in the appel­

 late opinion. If the appellate court reversed the court

 below, it would have changed the result reached below.

 Pleading. To allege or aver a matter of fact; to state it

 an appellate court of a judgment, order, or decree of a 
 lower court brought before it for review. See Affirm. 
   The ratification or confirmation of a voidable contract

 or act by the party who is to be bound thereby. The

 term is in accuracy to be distinguished from ratification,

 which is a recognition of the validity or binding force as

 against the party ratifying, of some act performed by

 another person; and 
 seem to apply more properly to cases where a doubtful 
  authority has been exercised by another in behalf of the
  person ratifying; but these distinctions are not general­
  ly observed.

  chequer, a day appointed by the judges of the common

  Affirmatio       unius      exclusio       est     alterius

  tems and procedures to prevent future discrimination;

Agnates I regneytsl regneytiyz/ .In the law of descents, 
 relations by the father, or on the father's side. This

 (q. v.).
Agnati lregneytay/.    In Roman law, the term included

 all the cognates who trace their connection exclusively

 through males. A table of cognates is formed by taking

 each lineal ancestor in turn and including all his de­ 
 scendants of both sexes in the tabular view. If, then, in 
 tracing the various branches of such a genealogical table 
 or tree, we stop whenever we come to the nam
 female, and pursue that particular branch or ramifica­ 
 tion no further, all who remain after the descendants of 
 women have been excluded are agnates, and their con­ 
 nection together is agnatic relationship. All persons are 
  agnatically connected together who are under the same
  patria potestas, or who have been under it, or who might
  have been under it if their lineal ancestor had lived long
  enough to exercise his empire.
  The agnate family consisted of all persons living at the
  same time, who would have been subject to the patris
  potestas of a common ancestor, if his life had been
  continued to their time.
  Cognates were all persons who could trace their blood
  to a single ancestor or ancestress, and agnates were
  those cognates who traced their connection exclusively
  through males. Between agnati and cognati there is
  this difference: that, under the name of agnati, cognati
  are included, but not e converso; for instance, a father's

 taken prisoner; (2) to make the lord's eldest son and 
 heir apparent a knight; (3) to give a suitable portion to 
 the lord's eldest daughter on her. A reasonable aid was 
 a duty claimed by the lord of the fee of his tenants, 
 holding by knight service, to marry his daughter, etc.

  annuities, and the like. A contract is aleatory or haz­
  ardous when the performance of that which is one of its

Alford plea.    Name derived from North Carolina v.

 Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970),

 in which Supreme Court held that a guilty plea which

 represented a voluntary and intelligent choice among

 alternatives available to defendant, especially where he 
 was represented by competent counsel, was not com­ 
 
 merely because the plea was entered to avoid the possi­ 
 bility of the death penalty. The Supreme Court also

 held that where strong evidence of actual guilt substan­

 tially negated defendant's claim of innocence and pro­

 vided strong factual basis for the guilty plea, and the

 state had a strong case of first-degree murder, so that

 defendant, advised by competent counsel, intelligently 
 concluded that he should plead guilty to second-degree 
 murder rather than be tried for first-degree murder, the 
 court committed no constitutional error in accepting 
 guilty plea despite defendant's claim of innocence.

All events test.   For accrual method taxpayers, income

 is earned when: (1) all the events have occurred which

 fix the right to receive the income and (2) the amount

 can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Accrual

 of income cannot be postponed simply because a portion

 of the income may have to be returned in a subsequent

 period.

 taxes or any other expense items if all the events fixing 
 the fact of, and amount of, taxpayer's liability have

 transpired though not paid, and this requires that each

 taxable year must be treated as a separate unit, and all

 items of gross income and deductions must be reflected

  ling will or trust instrument relative to the beneficiaries
  of an estate or trust.

  items of an estate or trust are allocated between income
  and corpus components. Specific items of income, ex­
  pense, gain, loss, and credit can be allocated to specific
  partners or shareholders in an S corporation, if a sub­

  An act done upon an instrument by which its meaning
  or language is changed. Language different in legal
  effect, or change in rights, interests, or obligations of
  parties. It introduces some change into instrument's
  terms, meaning, language, or details. The term is not
  properly applied to any change which involves the sub­
  stitution of a practically new document. An alteration
  is said to be material when it affects, or may possibly
  affect, the rights of the persons interested in the doc­
  ument. U.C.C. § 3-407. See also Fraudulent alteration;

  Alter ego 161t:;)r iygow/. Second self. Under doctrine of
  "alter ego", court merely disregards corporate entity
  and holds individual responsible for acts knowingly and
  intentionally done in the name of corporation. Ivy v.
  Plyler, 246 Cal.App.2d 678, 54 Cal.Rptr. 894, 897. To
  establish the "alter ego" doctrine, it must be shown that
 the stockholders disregarded the entity of the corpora­ 
 tion, made corporation a mere conduit for the transac­

 
 tion of their own private business, and that the separate

 
 individualities of the corporation and its stockholders in

 
 fact ceased to exist. Sefton v. San Diego Trust & Sav­

 
 ings Bank, Cal.App., 106 P.2d 974, 984. The doctrine of

 
 "alter ego" does not create assets for or in corporation,

 
 but it simply fastens liability on the individual who uses

 the corporation merely as an instrumentality in con­ 
 ducting his own personal business, and that liability 
 springs from fraud perpetrated not on the corporation, 
 but on third persons dealing with corporation. Garvin 
 v. Matthews, 193 Wash. 152, 74 P.2d 990, 992. See also

 powers to alternate, both in the preamble and the signa­ 
 tures, so that each power occupies, in the copy intended 
 
A
Alternate valuation date.      Property passing from a 
 person by death may be valued for estate tax purposes 
 as of the date of death or the alternate valuation date.

 of death or the date the property is disposed of by the

 estate, whichever comes first. The use of the alternate 
 valuation date requires an affirmative election on the 
 part of the executor or administrator of the estate.

Alternative dispute resolution.     Term refers to proce­ 
 dures for settling disputes by means other than litiga­ 
 tion; e.g., by arbitration, mediation, mini-trials. Such

 ditious, are increasingly being used in commercial and

 labor disputes, divorce actions, in resolving motor ve­

 hicle and medical malpractice tort claims, and in other

 disputes that would likely otherwise involve court litiga­

 tion. See also Arbitration; Mediation; Mini-trial; Trial 
 
  Alternative judgment.      See Judgment.
  Alternative minimum tax (AMT).         The tax imposed on
  individuals, estates, trusts, and, for tax years beginning
  after 1986, corporations. The tax is designed to ensure
  that all taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of
  taxes. The AMT rate is a fixed percentage of alterna­
  tive minimum taxable income. I.R.C. §§ 55-59.
  Alternative obligation. An obligation allowing the ob­
  ligor to choose which of two things he will do, the
  performance of either of which will satisfy the instru­
  ment. A promise to deliver a certain thing or to pay a
  specified sum of money is an example of this kind of
  obligation.
  Alternative pleading.    A form of pleading which was
  formerly prohibited but now recognized under Federal
  and state Rules of Civ.Proc. by which the pleader sets
  forth two or more statements by way of claim or defense
  which are not necessarily consistent with each other.
  When two or more statements are made in the alterna­
  tive and one of them if made independently would be
  sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the
  insufficiency of one or more of the alternative state­
  ments. See Fed.R.Civil P. 8(e)(2).
  Alternative relief. Under Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 8(a) the
  party seeking a judgment may demand it in the alterna­
  tive, or in various forms, e.g. demand for a money

  tion of property is made in alternative, one to take effect

  Alternative writ.    A common law writ commanding the
  person against whom it is issued to do a specified thing,
  or show cause to the court why he should not be com­
  pelled to do it. Under the common-law practice, the
  first mandamus is an alternative writ; but in modern
  practice this writ is often dispensed with and its place is
  taken by an order to show cause. See Mandamus.
  Alterum non lredere /olt�r�m non liyd�riy/.          Not to

 commands. Their responsibilities include negotiating 
  agreements between the United States and the host
  country, explaining and disseminating official U.S. poli­
  cy, and maintaining cordial relations with that country's
  government and people. 22 U.S.C.A. § 3942.
  A distinction was formerly made between Ambassa­

  Ambassadors Ordinary, who were sent on permanent
  missions; but this distinction is no longer observed.

   Ambiguity of language is to be distinguished from 
unintelligibility and inaccuracy, for words cannot be 
said to be ambiguous unless their signification seems 
doubtful and uncertain to persons of competent skill and 
k
uncertainty arising from the use of peculiar words, or of

common words in a peculiar sense. It is latent where 
the language employed 
suggests but a single meaning, but some extrinsic fact or 
extraneous evidence creates a necessity for interpreta­ 
tion or a choice among two or more possible meanings, 
as where a description apparently plain and unambig­

uous is shown to fit different pieces of property. Logue

Ambiguity upon the factum.      An ambiguity in relation

 
to the very foundation of the instrument itself, as distin­

guished from an ambiguity in regard to the construction

of its terms. The term is applied, for instance, to a

doubt as to whether a testator meant a particular clause 
to be a part of the will, or whether it was introduced

 
with his knowledge, or whether a codicil was meant to

republish a former will, or whether the residuary clause

was accidentally omitted.

  Early common law required complainant who lost his
  suit to pay his opponent "wer," monetary penalty which
  varied with the complainant's status, but after Norman

  Ancient street.   The doctrine is not based upon fact that
  streets have existed for a long time, but is invoked when
  it appears that common grantor owning land comprising
  street in question as well as property in question and
  other lots has given deeds to lots bounding them by

  use but at same time creating private easements in the
  street, which cannot be taken without compensation.

dently presented. Ortman v. Stanray Corp., C.A.Ill., 371

F.2d 154, 157. Such jurisdiction of federal court gener­

ally involves either proceedings which are concerned

with pleadings, processes, records or judgments of court

  546, 170 N.Y.S. 427, 428.
  It expresses a general relation or connection, a partic­
  ipation or accompaniment in sequence, having no inher­
  ent meaning standing alone but deriving force from
  what comes before and after. In its conjunctive sense
  the word is used to conjoin words, clauses, or sentences,
  expressing the relation of addition or connection, and
  signifying that something is to follow in addition to that
  which proceeds and its use implies that the connected
  elements must be grammatically co-ordinate, as where
  the elements preceding and succeeding the use of the
  words refer to the same subject matter. While it is said
  that there is no exact synonym of the word in English, it
  has been defined to mean "along with", "also", "and
  also", "as well as", "besides", "together with". Oliver v.
  Oliver, 286 Ky. 6, 149 S.W.2d 540, 542.

  effect the purpose of the parties as gathered from the
  contract taken as a whole, or, in other words, as will
  best accord with the equity of the situation. Bobrow v.

v. O'Cheskey, App., 87 N.M. 66, 529 P.2d 292, 293. A

fixed sum payable to a person at specified intervals for a

specific period of time or for life. Payments represent a 
partial return of capital and a return (interest) on the 
capital investment. Therefore, an exclusion ratio must 
generally be used to compute the amount of nontaxable 
i
plan annuities.
   The payment or receipt of a series of equal amounts of 
 money per period for a specified amount of time. In an 
 ordinary annuity, payments are made at the end of each 
 period; in an annuity due, payments are made at the

 difference between the total received and the price paid. 
 Contingent annuity. Funded annuity with payments to 
 commence on the happening of an uncertain event; e.g. 
 death of named person other than annuitant. An annu­ 
 ity whose number of payments depends upon the out­ 
 come of an event whose timing is uncertain at the time

 the annuity is set up.
 Deferred 
 future date provided the beneficiary is alive at such 
 
 
 ments, either for life or for a specified period, to annui­

  the annuitant from private as distinguished from public
  or life insurance company.
  Refund annuity. Annuitant is assured a specified annu­
  al sum during his life, with the further assurance that
  in the event of his premature death there will be paid to
  his estate an additional amount which represents the
  difference between the purchase price and the amount
  paid out during annuitant's life.
  Retirement annuity. Policy in which payments to an­
  nuitant commence at some future date; e.g. after retire­
  ment. If annuitant dies in interval or surrender is
  desired, an agreed upon amount is refunded to annui­
  tant's estate.
  Straight annuity. A contract usually by an insurance
  company to make periodic payments at monthly or
  yearly intervals; distinguishable from life insurance
  contract which looks to longevity, while annuity looks to
  transiency. Helvering v. LeGierse, 312 U.S. 531, 541, 61
  S.Ct. 646, 85 L.Ed. 996. Straight annuity contract calls
  for a fixed amount of payment as distinguished from the
  variable annuity.
  Straight life annuity. See Life annuity; Straight annui­
  ty, above.
  Survivorship annuity. See Joint and survivorship annu­
  ity, above.
  Variable annuity. A contract calling for payments to
  the annuitant in varying amounts depending on the
  success of the investment policy of the insurance compa­
  ny; unlike a straight annuity which requires the pay­
  ment of a fixed amount. Purpose of this type of annuity
  is to offset deflated value of dollar caused by inflation.
  Annuity policy.    An insurance policy providing for
  monthly or periodic payments to insured to begin at
  fixed date and continue through insured's life. Hamil­
  ton v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 196 Miss. 345, 17 So.2d
  278, 280.

  medical jurisprudence, the measurement of the human
  body. A system of measuring the dimensions of the
  human body, both absolutely and in their proportion to
  each other, the facial, cranial, and other angles, the
  shape and size of the skull, etc., for purposes of compari­
  son with corresponding measurements of other individu­
  als, and serving for the identification of the subject in
  cases of doubtful or disputed identity. It was largely
  adopted after its introduction in France in 1883, but fell
  into disfavor as being costly and as liable to error. It
  has given place to the "finger print" system devised by
  Francis Galton and to such identification procedures as
  DNA testing. See Bertillon System; DNA identification.
  Antichresis /rent�kriyz�s/. In the civil law, a species of
  mortgage, or pledge of immovables. An agreement by
  which the debtor gives to the creditor the income from
  the property which he has pledged, in lieu of the inter­
  est on his debt. In the French law, if the income was
  more than the interest, the debtor was entitled to de-
m
e
 
pledges,-the pawn and the antichresis. A pawn relates 
to movables
antichresis must be reduced to writing; and the creditor 
thereby acquires the 
immovables, deducting yearly thei
interest, in the 
principal of his debt. He is bound to pay taxes on the 
property, and keep it in repair, unless the contrary is 
agreed. The creditor does not become the proprietor of

the property by failure to pay at the agreed time, and 
any clause to that effect is void. He can only sue the 
debtor, and obtain sentence for sale of the property. 
The possession of the property is, however, by the con­ 
tract, transferred to the creditor. La.Civil Code Arts. 
3176-3181. The "antichresis" is an antiquated contract,

 
and has been resorted to in Louisiana in but a few
 
instances.

otherwise dealing with income before it becomes due.

   In patent law, an invention is anticipated by prior art 
when the invention is not new or lacks novelty over that 
art. Topliff v. Topliff, 145 U.S. 156, 12 S.Ct. 825, 36 
L.Ed. 658. Defense of "anticipation" in suit for patent 
infringement is made out when, except for insubstantial 
differences, the prior patent contains all of the same 
elements operating in the same fashion to perform an 
identical function. Ropat Corp. v. West Bend Co., D.C.

 
Ill., 382 F.Supp. 1030, 1036. Unless all of same ele­

 
ments are found in exactly same situation and are
 
united in same way to perform identical function in a

single prior art reference, there is no "anticipation" 
which will invalidate that patent. Ceramic Tilers Sup­ 
ply, Inc. v. Tile Council of America, Inc., C.A.Cal., 378 
F.2d 283, 284.
 
   In law of negligence, "anticipation" is not confined to

 
 expectation. It means probability, not possibility, as

 
 applied to duty to anticipate consequences of conduct

 
 attacked as negligent. Empire Dist. Electric Co. v. Har­

 
 ris, C.C.A.Mo., 82 F.2d 48, 52.
 
Anticipation note.   Discount or rebate for prepayment.

 
Anticipatory assignment 
 (Assignment of income).
 
Anticipatory breach of contract.      The assertion by a 
 party to a contract that he or she will not perform a 
 future obligation as required by the contract. Such 
 occurs when a party to an executory contract manifests

 
 a definite and unequivocal intent prior to time fixed in

 
 contract that it will not render its performance under

 
 the contract when that time arrives, and in such a case

 
 the other party may treat the contract as ended. Leazzo

 v. Dunham, 95 Ill.App.3d 847, 51 Ill.Dec. 437, 440, 420 
 
  The right of one party to a contract to sue for breach
  before the date set for performance when the other
  party conveys his intention not to perform (U.C.C.
  § 2-610), though the repudiating party may retract his
  repUdiation prior to date for performance if the other
  party has not acted on the repudiation (U.C.C. § 2-611).
  Some jurisdictions require the aggrieved party to wait
  for the date for performance before commencing suit.

  SIegel, 135 N.J.Eq. 5, 37 A.2d 57, 58. "Any" does not
  necessarily mean only one person, but may have refer­
  ence to more than one or to many. Doherty v. King,
  Tex.Civ.App., 183 S.W.2d 1004, 1007.
  Word "any" has a diversity of meaning and may be
  employed to indicate "all" or "every" as well as "some"
  or "one" and its meaning in a given statute depends
  upon the context and the subject matter of the statute.
  Donohue v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Town of Norwalk,
  155 Conn. 550, 235 A.2d 643, 646, 647.
  It is often synonymous with "either", "every", or
  "all". Its generality may be restricted by the context;
  thus, the giving of a right to do some act "at any time"
  is commonly construed as meaning within a reasonable
  time; and the words "any other" following the enumer­
  ation of particular classes are to be read as "other such
  like," and include only others of like kind or character.

technicality; a rule of law carried to an extreme point,

either of severity or refinement. A term used to denote

a stricter application of the rules of law than is indi­

cated by the phrase summum jus (q. v.).
Apex rule.   In mining law, the mineral laws of the

United States give to the locator of a mining claim on

the public domain the whole of every vein the apex of

which lies within his surface exterior boundaries, or

within perpendicular planes drawn downward indefi­
nitely on the planes of those boundaries; and he may

follow a vein which thus apexes within his boundaries, 
o
perpendicular in its course downward as to extend out­ 
side the vertical side-lines of his location; but he may 
not go beyond his end-lines or vertical planes drawn 
downward therefrom. This is called the apex rule. 30 
U
Aphasia / �feyzh(iy)�/.   Loss of the faculty or power of

 articulate speech. A condition in which the patient, 
 while retaining intelligence and understanding and with 
 the organs of speech unimpaired, is unable (in "motor

 aphasia") to utter articulate words, or unable to vocalize 
 the particular word which is in his mind and which he 
 wishes to use, or utters words different from those he 
 believes himself to be speaking, or (in "sensory aphasia" 
 or apraxia) is unable to understand spoken or written 
 language. Sensory aphasia includes word blindness and 
 
 aphasia often includes agraphia, or the inability to write 
 words of the desired meaning. The seat of the disease is 
 in the brain, but it is not a form of insanity.
Aphonia / �fowniy�/.      Loss of the power of articulate 
 speech in consequence of defective conditions of some of 
 the vocal organs. It may be incomplete, in which case 
 the patient can whisper. It is to be distinguished from 
 congenital inability to speak, and from temporary loss of 
 voice through extreme hoarseness or minor affections of 
 the vocal cords, as also from aphasia, the latter being a

 disease of the brain without impairment of the organs of

 speech.
Apices juris non 
 s;}nt jur� (OJ:}s)/. Extremities, or mere subtleties of law

  the prejudice of the original owners.
  Apocha (alsoApoca) /rep�k�/. Lat. In the civil law, a

 ity as the principal knowingly or negligently permits the

 agent to assume, or which he holds the agent out as

 possessing. Such authority as he appears to have by

 reason of the actual authority which he has. Such
 authority as a reasonably prudent man, using diligence

 and discretion, in view of the principal's conduct, would 
 naturally suppose the agent to possess.         Finnegan 
 Constr. Co. v. Robino-Ladd Co., 354 A.2d 142, 144. Such 
 authority as a principal intentionally or by want of

  Appeal.    Resort to a superior (i.e. appellate) court to
  review the decision of an inferior (i.e. trial) court or
  administrative agency. A complaint to a higher tribu­
  nal of an error or injustice committed by a lower tribu­
  nal, in which the error or injustice is sought to be
  corrected or reversed. Board of Ed. of Cleveland City
  School Dist. v. Cuyahoga County Bd. of Revision, 34
  Ohio St.2d 231, 298 N.E.2d 125, 128. There are two
  stages of appeal in the federal and many state court
  systems; to wit, appeal from trial court to intermediate
  appellate court and then to Supreme Court. There may
  also be several levels of appeal within an administrative
  agency; e.g. appeal from decision of Administrative Law
  Judge to Appeals Council in social security case. In
  addition, an appeal may be taken from an administra­
  tive agency to a trial court (e.g. from Appeals Council in
  social security case to U.S. district court). Also, an
  appeal may be as of right (e.g. from trial court to
  intermediate appellate court) or only at the discretion of
  the appellate court (e.g. by writ of certiorari to U.S.
  Supreme Court). Provision may also exist for joint or
  consolidated appeals (e.g. Fed.R.App.P. 3) and for cross
  appeals (where both parties to a judgment appeal there­
  from).
  Appeal was also the name formerly given to the proceed­
  ing in English law where a person, indicted of treason or
  felony, and arraigned for the same, confessed the fact
  before plea pleaded, and appealed, or accused others, his
  accomplices in the same crime, in order to obtain his
  pardon. In this case he was called an "approver" or
  "prover," and the party appealed or accused, the "appel­
  lee."
  See also Consolidated appeal; Courts of Appeals, U .S.;
  Cross appeal; Interlocutory appeal; Interlocutory Appeals
  Act; Limited appeal.
  Appealable order.     A decree or order which is suffi­
  ciently final to be entitled to appellate review, as con-
trasted with an interlocutory order which generally is 
not appealable until the case has been tried and judg­ 
m
judgment is not appealable but the allowance of such 
motion is a final judgment and hence appealable.
Fed.R. Civil P. 56.
Appeal bond.     The court in its discretion may require 
 the appellant to file a bond or provide other security to

 ensure payment of costs on appeal. See e.g. , Fed.R.

Appearance.     A coming into court as party to a suit, 
 either in person or by attorney, whether as plaintiff or 
 defendant. The formal proceeding by which a defen­ 
 dant submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court.

 The voluntary submission to a court's jurisdiction.

   In civil actions the parties do not normally actually 
 appear in person, but rather through their attorneys 
 (who enter their appearance by filing written pleadings, 
 or a formal written entry of appearance). Also, at many 
 stages of criminal proceedings, particularly involving

 minor offenses, the defendant's attorney appears on his

 behalf. See e.g., Fed.R.Crim.P. 43.
   An appearance may be either general or special ; the

 former is a simple and unqualified or unrestricted sub­

 mission to the jurisdiction of the court, the latter a 
 submission to the jurisdiction for some specific purpose 
 only, not for all the purposes of the suit. A special 
 appearance is for the purpose of testing or objecting to 
 the sufficiency of service or the jurisdiction of the court 
 over defendant without submitting to such jurisdiction; 
 
 waives defects of service and submits to the jurisdiction 
 of court. Insurance Co. of North America v. Kunin, 175 
 
     See also General appearance; Notice to appear.

  former where it was compelled by process served on the
  A       party, the latter where it was entered by his own will or
  consent, without the service of process, though process
  may be outstanding. Also, optional when entered by a
  person who intervened in the action to protect his own
  interests, though not joined as a party; conditional,
  when coupled with conditions as to its becoming or being
  taken as a general appearance; gratis, when made by a
  party to the action, but before the service of any process
  or legal notice to appear; de bene esse, when made
  provisionally or to remain good only upon a future
  contingency; or when designed to permit a party to a
  proceeding to refuse to submit his person to the jurisdic­
  tion of the court unless it was finally determined that he
  had forever waived that right; subsequent, when made
  by a defendant after an appearance had already been
  entered for him · by the plaintiff; corporal, when the
  person was physically present in court.
  Initial appearance. A court proceeding for a defendant
  charged with a felony, during which the judge advises
  the defendant of the charges against him and of his
  rights, decides upon bail and/or other conditions of
  release, and sets the date for a preliminary hearing.
  See e.g. Fed.R.Crim.P. 5.
  Notice of appearance. A notice given by defendant to a
  plaintiff that he appears in the action in person or by
  attorney.
  Appearance doctrine.    This doctrine is a special rule
  designed to afford a right of self-defense to defendant

  Woodruff v. Bell, 143 Kan. 1 10, 53 P.2d 498, 499.
  Appellate court.  A court having jurisdiction of appeal
  and review; a court to which causes are removable by
  appeal, certiorari, error or report. A reviewing court,

 See e.g. Court of Appeals; Court of Customs and Patent 
 Appeals; Court of Military Appeals; Supreme court. 
Appellate division. An intermediate appellate court for 
hearing civil appeals. See e.g., Mass.G.L. c. 231, § 108.

Appellate jurisdiction.     The power vested in an appel­ 
late court to review and revise the judicial action of an 
inferior court, evidenced by an appealable order or an 
appealable judgment
v . .Mongeon, N.D., 200 N.W.2d 50, 53. The power and 
authority to take cognizance of a cause and proceed to 
its determination, not in its initial stages (i.e. original

 
jurisdiction) but only after it has been finally decided by

 
an inferior court, i.e., the power of review and determi­

 
nation on appeal, writ of error, certiorari, or other

similar process. Jurisdiction on appeal; jurisdiction to 
revise or correct the proceedings in a cause already 
instituted and acted upon by an
tribunal having the attributes of 
appellate jurisdiction are governed by statutes (e.g. 28

Appellee. The party in a cause against whom an appeal 
 is taken; that is, the party who has an interest adverse 
 to setting aside or reversing the judgment. Sometimes

  another inheritance which is more worthy; as an advow­
  son, common, etc., which may be appendant to a manor,
  common of fishing to a freehold, a seat in a church to a
  house, etc. It differs from appurtenance, in that appen­
  dant must ever be by prescription, i.e., a personal usage
  for a considerable time, while an appurtenance may be
  created at this day; for if a grant be made to a man and
  his heirs, of common in such a moor for his beasts levant
  or couchant upon his manor, the commons are appurte­
  nant to the manor, and the grant will pass them.
  See also Appendix; Appurtenance; Appurtenant.

values used in determining the tax are to be used for

that purpose. If the decedent's will directs a method of

  ceeding a court determines the appraised value of their
  shares and the corporation pays such appraised value to
  the shareholder in cash. The Revised Model Business

  obtain payment for their shares" to describe this right.
  An appraisal right exists only to the extent specifically
  provided by statute. See Appraisal remedy.
  Appraisal clause.    Clause in insurance policy providing
  that the insurer has the right to demand an appraisal of

  Appraisal remedy.      The dissenting shareholder's ap­
  praisal remedy is essentially a statutory creation to
  enable shareholders who object to certain extraordinary
  matters to dissent and to require the corporation to buy
  their shares at the value immediately prior to the ap­
  proval of such matter and thus to withdraw from the
  corporation. In different jurisdictions, the appraisal
  remedy often applies to sales of substantially all corpo­
  rate assets other than in the regular course of business,
  mergers, and consolidations, more rarely to certain
  amendments of the articles of incorporation or miscella­
  neous matters, but usually not to dissolution. The ap­
  praisal remedy is often limited to shareholders of record
  entitled to vote on the matter.

  ment drawn from inconvenience is of the greatest
  weight [is forcible] in law. If there be in any deed or

  the true intention of the grantor; but where there is no
  equivocal expression in the instrument, and the words
  used admit only of one meaning, arguments of inconven­
  ience prove only want of foresight in the grantor.

 statute embodies a distinct policy which requires that 
 federal legal principles control its disposition. Comtron­ 
 ics, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., D.C.Puerto Rico, 409

  Assassination    / �sres�neysh�n/.   Murder committed,
  usually, though not necessarily, for hire, without direct

  er by the person upon whom the crime is committed;
  though an assassination of a public figure might be done
  by one acting alone for personal, social or political
  reasons. It is a federal crime, punishable as a homicide,
  to assassinate the President, President-elect, Vice Presi­
  dent, or if there is no Vice President, the officer next in
  order of succession to the office of President, the Vice­
  President-elect, or any individual who is acting as Presi­
  dent under the Constitution. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1751. In

  Assault.   Any willful attempt or threat to inflict injury
  upon the person of another, when coupled with an

  fear or expect immediate bodily harm, constitutes an
  assault. An assault may be committed without actually
  touching, or striking, or doing bodily harm, to the per­
  son of another. State v. Murphy, 7 Wash.App. 505, 500
  P.2d 1276, 1281.
  Frequently used to describe illegal force which is
  technically a battery. For crime of assault victim need
  not be apprehensive of fear if the outward gesture is
  menacing and defendant intends to harm, though for
  tort of assault, element of victim's apprehension is re­
  quired. Com. v. Slaney, 345 Mass. 135, 185 N.E.2d 919.
  It is unlawful attempt to commit a battery. People v.

N.E.2d 807, 809. The two crimes differ from each other

in that battery requires physical contact of some sort

(bodily injury or offensive touching), whereas assault is

committed without physical contact. In most jurisdic­ 
tions, statutes have created aggravated assaults and 
batteries, punishable as felonies, and worded in various

  then due or to become due to the drawer, the delivery of
  the order to the payee operates as an assignment pro
  tanto of the fund. Doyle v. East New York Sav. Bank,
  44 N.Y.S.2d 318, 323.
  Assignment with preferences. An assignment for the
  benefit of creditors, with directions to the assignee to
  prefer a specified creditor or class of creditors, by paying
  their claims in full before the others receive any divi­
  dend, or in some other manner. More usually termed a
  "preferential assignment." Such assignments formerly
  constituted an "act of bankruptcy" (q. v.). See Assign­
  ment for benefit of creditors, above.
  Foreign assignment. An assignment made in a foreign
  country, or in another state.
  General assignment. An assignment made for the bene­
  fit of all the assignor's creditors, instead of a few only;
  or one which transfers the whole of his estate to the
  assignee, instead of a part only.
  Voluntary assignment. An assignment for the benefit of
  his creditors made by a debtor voluntarily, as distin­
  guished from a compulsory assignment which takes
  place by operation of law in proceedings in bankruptcy.
  Such constitutes an assignment of a debtor's property in
  trust to pay his debts generally, in distinction from a
  transfer of property to a particular creditor in payment
  of his demand, or to a conveyance by way of collateral
  security or mortgage.
  Assignor / �sayn�r/ . A person who assigns or transfers

  a certain place, at an appointed time. The verdict or

  Comm. 57, 59.
  In later English law, the name "assizes" or "assises"
  was given to the court, time, or place where the judges
  of assize and nisi prius, who were sent by special com­
  mission from the crown on circuits through the king­
  dom, proceeded to take indictments, and to try such
  disputed causes issuing out of the courts at Westminster
  as were then ready for trial, with the assistance of a
  jury from the particular county. These judges of assize
  were the successors of the ancient "justices in eyre."
  They sat by virtue of four separate authorities: (1)
  Commission of Oyer and Terminer, (2) of goal delivery,
  (3) of nisi prius, and (4) Commission of Peace. In 1971
  the Crown Court was established which superseded the
  criminal jurisdiction of courts of assize and all the
  jurisdiction of quarter sessions. The assize courts were
  accordingly abolished.
  Anything reduced to a certainty in respect to time,
  number, quantity, quality, weight, measure, etc.

  highest remedy, there can be no recourse (going back) to
  an inferior action, nor assistance (derived from it). A
  maxim in the old law of real actions, when there were
  grades in the remedies given; the rule being that a

  Assumpsit /�sam(p)s�tI.     Lat. He undertook; he prom­
  ised.
  A promise or engagement by which one person as­
  sumes or undertakes to do some act or pay something to
  another. It may be either oral or in writing, but is not
  under seaL It is express if the promisor puts his engage­
  ment in distinct and definite language; it is implied
  where the law infers a promise (though no formal one
  has passed) from the conduct of the party or the circum­
  stances of the case. Dukes v. Rogers, 67 Ga.App. 661, 21
  S.E.2d 295, 297.
  A common law form of action which lies for the
  recovery of damages for the non-performance of a parol
  or simple contract; or a contract that is neither of
  record nor under seaL A liberal and equitable action,
  applicable to almost every case where money has been
  received which in equity and good conscience ought to
  be refunded; express promise is not necessary to sustain
  action, but it may be maintained whenever anything is
  received or done from the circumstances of which the
  law implies a promise of compensation. The action of
  assumpsit differs from trespass and trover, which are
  founded on a tort, not upon a contract; from covenant
  and debt, which are appropriate where the ground of
  recovery is a sealed instrument, or special obligation to
  pay a fixed sum; and from replevin, which seeks the
  recovery of specific property, if attainable, rather than
  of damages.
  Express assumpsit. See Express assumpsit.
  General (common or indebitatus) assumpsit is an action
  of assumpsit brought upon the promise or contract im­
  plied by law in certain cases. It is founded uport what
  the law terms an implied promise on the part of defen­
  dant to pay what, in good conscience, he is bound to pay
  to plaintiff.

for him, without any agreement as to his compensation,

 
the law implies a promise from the employer to the
workman that he will pay him for his services as much 
 
as he may deserve or merit. In such case, the plaintiff

may suggest in his declaration that the defendant prom­ 
 
ised to pay him as much as he reasonably deserved, and

money, which the defendant has omitted to pay. This is

one's self. The undertaking or 
obligation primarily resting upon another, as where the 
purchaser of real estate "assumes" a mortgage resting 
upon it, in which case he adopts the mortgage debt as 
his own and becomes personally liable for its payment. 
The difference between the purchaser of land assuming

a mortgage on it and simply buying subject to the
mortgage, is that in the former case he makes himself 
personally liable for the payment of the mortgage debt, 
while in the latter case he does not. When he takes the 
conveyance subject to the mortgage, he is bound only to 
t
lease, he takes to himself the obligations, contracts, 
agreements, and benefits to which the other contracting 
party was entitled under the terms of the lease. See 
A

 mortgage may not be assumed without written consent

 transferee agrees to assume an obligation of the trans­

 feror.

 County Excise Board v. Kurn, 187 Okl. 110, 101 P.2d 
 
Assumption of mortgage.       To take or acquire a mort­ 
 gage or deed of trust from some prior holder. Thus, a 
 purchaser may assume or take over the 
 seller. Often this requires permission of the mortgagee. 
 This is distinguishable from taking equity of redemption 
 subject to mortgage because in latter case grantee is not 
 contractually bound to pay mortgage,
  assumes the mortgage, he binds himself to mortgagor to
  pay the mortgage and to fulfill all other . terms and
  conditions of mortgage. See also Assumption.
  Assumption of risk. The doctrine of assumption of risk,
  also known as volenti non fit injuria, means legally that
  a plaintiff may not recover for an injury to which he
  assents, i.e., that a person "may not recover for an injury
  received when he voluntarily exposes himself to a
  known and appreciated danger. The requirements for
  the defense of volenti non fit injuria are that: (1) the
  plaintiff has knowledge of facts constituting a dangerous
  condition, (2) he knows the condition is dangerous, (3) he
  appreciates the nature or extent of the danger, and (4)
  he voluntarily exposes himself to the danger. An excep­
  tion may be applicable even though the above factors
  have entered into a plaintiffs conduct if his actions
  come within the rescue or humanitarian doctrine.
  Clarke v. Brockway Motor Trucks, D.C.Pa., 372 F.Supp.
  1342, 1347.
  A defense to action of negligence which consists of
  showing that the plaintiff, knowing the dangers and risk
  involved, chose to act as he did. An affirmative defense
  which the defendant in a negligence action must plead
  and prove. Fed.R.Civil P. 8(c). It is not a defense under
  state workers' compensation laws or in FELA actions.
  Many states have abolished the defense of assumption of
  risk in automobile cases with the enactment of no-fault
  insurance acts or comparative negligence acts.
  See also Volenti non fit injuria.
  Secondary assumption of risk. Such occurs when indi­
  vidual voluntarily encounters known, appreciated risk
  without an intended manifestation by that individual
  that he consents to relieve another of his duty. Calvert
  v. Garvey Elevators, Inc., 236 Kan. 570, 694 P.2d 433,
  437.
  Assurance.    The act or action of assuring; e.g. a pledge,
  guaranty, or surety. A declaration tending to inspire
  full confidence.
  The deed or instrument by which real property is
  conveyed; also, the act of conveying such.
  Same as "Insurance"; term used in Canada and Eng­
  land.
  In England, the legal evidences of the transfer of
  property are called the "common assurances" of the
  kingdom, whereby every man's estate is assured to him,
  and all controversies, doubts, and difficulties are either
  prevented or removed.
  Assurance, further, covenant for.      See Covenant (Cove­
  nant for further assurance).
  Assure.   To make certain and put beyond doubt. To
  declare, aver, avouch, assert, or ensure positively. To
  declare solemnly; to assure to any one with design of
  inspiring belief or confidence. Used interchangeably
  with "insure" in insurance law. In real property doc­
  uments it means a warranty; and in business doc­
  uments, generally, it means a pledge or security. Utili­
  ties Engineering Institute v. Kofod, 185 Misc. 1035, 58

 shelter, security, protection. While a foreign country 
 has the right to offer an asylum to fugitives from other 
 countries, there is no corresponding right on the part of 
 the alien to claim asy

 refugee status in the United States if the alien has a 
 well-founded fear of persecution in his or her home 
 country. To be eligible for either asylum or refugee

 status, the applicant must qualify as a refugee, as de­

 fined by 8 U.S.C.A. § 1l01(aX42). Also, under the Refu­

 gee Act of 1980, "an alien physically present in the 
 United States or at a land border or port of entry . . . 
  may be granted asylum in the discretion of the Attorney
  General if the Attorney General determines that such
  alien is a refugee . . . . " 8 U.S.C.A. § 1158(a).

  indicate presence or occurrence in, on, or near; or to
  indicate the means, cause, or manner; or to indicate
  that with which one is occupied or employed. As used
  to fix a time, it does not necessarily mean eo instante or
  the identical time named, or even a fixed definite mo­
  ment. Often expresses simply nearness and proximity,
  and consequently may denote a reasonable time.

 "atmatertera magna. "                                         At once.    In contracts of various kinds the phrase is 
 construed as synonymous with "immediately" and
 "forthwith," where the subject-matter is the giving of

 notice. The use of such term does not ordinarily call for

 instantaneous action, but rather that notice shall be

 given within such time as is reasonable in view of the

 circumstances. Likewise, contracts or statutes requiring 
 the performance of a particular act "at once" are usual­ 
 ly held to mean simply within a reasonable time. An 
 order to "ship at once" is synonymous with "as soon as 
 possible". Myers v. Hardin, 208 Ark. 505, 186 S.W.2d 
 925, 928.

  At-risk amount. The taxpayer has an amount at risk in
  a business or investment venture to the extent that it
  has subjected personal assets to the risks of the business.
  Typically, the taxpayer's at-risk amount includes (1) the
  amount of money or other property that the investor
  contributed to the venture for the investment, (2) the
  amount of any of the entity's liabilities for which the
  taxpayer personally is liable and that relate to the
  investment, and (3) an allocable share of nonrecourse
  debts incurred by the venture from third parties in
  arm's length transactions, with respect to real estate
                                                       .

  ductible losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk.
  Amounts at risk include the cash investment, and the

Attachment.      The legal process of seIzmg another's 
 property in accordance with a writ or judicial order for 
 the purpose of securing satisfaction of a judgment yet to 
 be rendered. The act or process of taking, apprehend­

 ing, or seizing persons or property, by virtue of a writ, 
 summons, or other judicial order, and bringing the same 
 into the custody of the court for the purpose of securing 
 satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in 
 the action. While formerly the main objective of attach­ 
 ment was to coerce the defendant debtor to appear in 
 court by seizer of his property, today the writ of attach­ 
 ment is used primarily to seize the debtor's property in 
 order to secure the debt or claim of the creditor in the 
 
 attachment is governed strictly by state statutes, with 
 such differing considerably as to when attachment is 
 available (the majority of states providing that such is

 available at or after the commenc
 action until entry of judgment). Federal courts follow 
 the local rules or statutes relating to attachment. Fed. 
 
   A remedy ancillary to an action by which plaintiff is

 enabled to acquire a lien upon property or effects of 
 defendant for satisfaction of judgment which plaintiff

 Commercial law. When the three basic prerequisites of 
 a security interest exist (agreement, value, and collat­ 
 era!), the security agreement becomes enforceable be­ 
 
 
 
 Domestic and foreign. In some jurisdictions it is com­ 
 
 issuing against a resident debtor (upon the special 
 ground of fraud, intention to abscond, etc.), and to desig­ 
 nate an attachment against a non-resident, or his prop­ 
 
   Where the defendant is a non-resident, or beyond the 
 territorial jurisdiction of the court, his goods or land 
 within the territory may be seized upon process of 
 attachment; whereby he will be compelled to enter an 
 appearance, or the court acquires jurisdiction so far as 
 to dispose of the property attached. This is sometimes 
 called "foreign attachment." In such a case, the pro- 
  ceeding becomes in substance one in rem against the
  attached property.
  Persons. A writ issued by a court of record, command­
  ing the sheriff to bring before it a person who has been
  guilty of contempt of court, either in neglect or abuse of
  its process or of subordinate powers. A capias (q. v.).
  Property. A species of mesne process, by which a writ is
  An at­   issued at the institution or during the progress of an
  action, commanding the sheriff to seize the property,
  rights, credits, or effects of the defendant to be held as
  security for the satisfaction of such judgment as the
  plaintiff may recover. It is principally used against
  absconding, concealed, or fraudulent debtors. Mass.R.
  Civil P. 4.1.
  Attachment bond.      A bond used to dissolve an attach­
  ment so as to free the property subject to the attach­
  ment for sale or other disposition; may be surety compa­
  ny bond or personal bond with sureties. Plaintiff then
  looks to bond for satisfaction of his judgment.
  Attachment execution. A name given in some states to
  a process of garnishment for the satisfaction of a judg­
  ment. As to the judgment debtor it is an execution; but
  as to the garnishee it is an original process-a summons
  commanding him to appear and show cause, if any he
  has, why the judgment should not be levied on the goods
  and effects of the defendant in his hands.
  Attachment of privilege.       In old English law, a process
  by which a man, by virtue of his privilege, calls another
  to litigate in that court to which he himself belongs, and
  who has the privilege to answer there. A writ issued to
  apprehend a person in a privileged place.
  Attachment of risk.     Used to describe point in time,
  generally when title passes, when risk of loss for de­
  struction of property which is subject of sale passes to
  buyer from seller. U.C.C. § 2-509.
  Attachment of the forest.      In old English law, one of
  the three courts formerly held in forests. The highest
  court was called "justice in eyre's seat;" the middle, the

  Attain.  To reach or come to by progression or motion;
  to arrive at; as, to attain a ripe old age. Watkins v.
  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 156 Kan. 27, 131 P.2d 722,
  723.
  Attainder /;}teynd;}r/.  At common law, that extinction
  of civil rights and capacities which took place whenever
  a person who had committed treason or felony received
  sentence of death for his crime.
  The effect of "attainder" upon such felon was, in
  general terms, that all his estate, real and personal, was
  forfeited. At the common law, attainder resulted in
  three ways, viz.: by confession, by verdict, and by process
  or outlawry. The first case was where the prisoner
  pleaded guilty at the bar, or having fled to sanctuary,
  confessed his guilt and abjured the realm to save his life.
  The second was where the prisoner pleaded not guilty at
  the bar, and the jury brought in a verdict against him.
 The third, when the person accused made his escape and 
 
   In England, by statute 33 & 34 Vict. c. 23, attainder 
upon conviction, with consequent corruption of blood, 
forfeiture, or escheat, was abolished.
States, the doctrine of attainder is now scarcely known, 
although during and shortly after the Revolution acts of 
attainder
passage of such bills is expressly forbidden by the Con­ 
s
 Bills of attainder. Such special acts of the legislature as 
 inflict capital punishments upon persons supposed to be 
 guilty of high offenses, such as treason and felony,

 without any conviction in the ordinary course of judicial

 proceedings. If an act inflicts a milder degree of punish­ 
 ment than death, it is called a "bill of pains and penal­

 ties," but both are included in the 
 Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 9). Losier v. Sherman, 157 
 Kan. 153, 138 P.2d 272, 273; State v. Graves, 352 Mo. 
 
Attaint I ;;)teynt/.Attainted, stained, or blackened. 
   In old English practice, a writ which lay to inquire

 whether a jury of twelve men had given a false verdict,

 in order that the judgment might be reversed. 3 Bl.

 Comm. 402. This inquiry was made by a grand assise or

 jury of twenty-four persons, usually knights, and, if they

 found the verdict a false one, the judgment was that the

 jurors should become infamous, should forfeit their

 goods and the profits of their lands, should themselves

 be imprisoned, and their wives and children thrust out

 of doors, should have their houses razed, their trees

 extirpated, and thei
 plaintiff should be restored to all that he lost by reason 
 
Attaint d'une cause I;;)teyn d(y)uwn k6wz/.      In French 
 
Attempt.   In statutes and in cases other than criminal 
 prosecutions an "attempt" ordinarily means an intent 
 combined with an act falling short of the thing intended. 
 It may be described as an endeavor to do an act, carried 
 beyond mere preparation, but short of execution.
 Criminal law. An intent to commit a crime coupled
 with an act taken toward committing the offense. An

 effort or endeavor to accomplish a crime, amounting to

 more than mere preparation or planning for it, which, if 
 not prevented, would have resulted in the full consum­ 
 mation of the act attempted, but which, in fact, does not 
 bring to pass the party's ultimate design. The requisite 
 elements of an "attempt" to commit a crime are: (1) an 
 intent to commit it, (2) an overt act toward its commis­ 
 sion, (3) failure of consummation, and (4) the apparent 
 possibility of commission. State v. Stewart, Mo.App., 
 
    A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, 
 acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required 
 for commission of the crime, he: (a) purposely engages 
 in conduct which would constitute 
 attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; 
 or (b) when causing a particular result is an element of 
  the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose
  of causing or with the belief that it will cause such
  result without further conduct on his part; or (c) pur­
  posely does or omits to do anything which, under the
  circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or
  omission constituting a substantial step in a course of
  conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the
  crime. Model Penal Code, § 5.01.
  Attendant,   n. One who owes a duty or service to anoth­
  er, or in some sort depends upon him. One who follows

  Attendant,     adj. Accompanying, or connected with.
  Attendant circumstances. Facts surrounding an event;
  e.g. the time, place and declarations of a testator prior to
  and immediately following execution of his will.
  Attendant terms.      In English law, terms (usually mort­
  gages), for a long period of years, which are created or
  kept outstanding for the purpose of attending or waiting
  upon and protecting the inheritance. A phrase used in
  conveyancing to denote estates which are kept alive,
  after the objects for which they were originally created
  have ceased, so that they might be deemed merged or
  satisfied, for the purpose of protecting or strengthening
  the title of the owner. By the Satisfied Terms Act of
  1845, any attendant term becoming satisfied after the
  Act immediately ceased. But the Act did not apply to
  leaseholds. That Act was repealed and replaced by Sec.
  5 of the Law of Property Act of 1925, which applies to
  terms created out of leaseholds as well as terms created
  out of freeholds.
  Attentat I ;;)tent;;)t/.   Lat. He attempts.
  In the civil and canon law, anything wrongfully inno­
  vated or attempted in a suit by an inferior judge (or

  off; the granting of a time or term, as for the payment
  of a debt.
  Attermoiement.     In canon law, a making terms; a com­
  position, as with creditors.
  Attest.  To bear witness to; to bear witness to a fact; to
  affirm to be true or genuine; to act as a witness to; to
  certify; to certify to the verity of a copy of a public
  document formally by signature; to make solemn decla­
  ration in words or writing to support a fact; to signify
  by subscription of his name that the signer has wit­
  nessed the execution of the particular instrument.
  Lindsey v. Realty Trust Co., Tex.Civ.App., 75 S.W.2d
  322, 324; City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport v. Borsuk, 131
  Conn. 640, 41 A.2d 775, 778. Also the technical word by
  which, in the practice in many of the states, a certifying
  officer gives assurance of the genuineness and correct­
  ness of a copy. Thus, an "attested" copy of a document
 is one which has been examined and compared with the 
 original, with a certificate or memorandum of its cor­ 
 rectness, signed by the persons who have examined it. 
 
Attestation.   The act of witnessing an ins

  authorized to act in the place or stead of another. An
  agent, or one acting on behalf of another. Sherts v.

  such before courts, administrative agencies, boards, etc.
  In English law, a public officer belonging to the supe­
  rior courts of common law at Westminster, who conduct­
  ed legal proceedings on behalf of others, called his
  clients, by whom he was retained; he answered to the
  solicitor in the courts of chancery, and the proctor of the
  admiralty, ecclesiastical, probate, and divorce courts.
  An attorney was almost invariably also a solicitor. It
  was provided by the judicature act, 1873, § 87, that
  solicitors, attorneys, or proctors of, or by law empowered
  to practice in, any court the jurisdiction of which is by
  that act transferred to the high court of justice or the
  court of appeal, shall be called "solicitors of the supreme
  court."
