Black's Law Dictionary 6th Ed.

2nd Reprint-1990
                            PREFACE



    This new Sixth Edition starts a second century for Black's Law
Dictionary-the standard authority for legal definitions since 1891.

    Nearly every area of the law has undergone change and develop­
ment since publication of the Fifth· Edition in 1979.   This period has
seen particular change and expansion in such areas as tax, finance,
commercial transactions, debtor-creditor relations, tort liability, em­
ployment, health care, environment, and criminal law.       Congress and
the states continue to legislate new rights and remedies;     the courts
continue to define and redefine legal terms; the states are increasingly
adopting uniform or model laws and rules; and new causes of action
and legal concepts continue unabated.

    The vocabulary of the law has likewise continued to change and
expand to keep pace.     This has necessitated not only a significant
expansion of new words and terms for inclusion in this Sixth Edition,
but also a reexamination of all existing entries for currentness of legal
usage. Indicative of this growth is that this new edition required the
addition or revision of over 5,000 legal words and terms.   Thousands of
other changes were required to update or supplement supporting cita­
tions.

    As with prior editions, considerable effort has been made in this
Sixth Edition to provide more than basic definitions of legal words and
terms.   In those instances where traditional legal concepts and doc­
trines have over the years been either superseded, modified or supple­
mented by court decisions or legislation, such developments and
changes are fully reflected. Additionally, because so many areas of law
and practice are now governed by uniform or model acts and rules, such
major sources of law as the Uniform Commercial Code, Restatements of
the Law, Model Penal Code, and Federal Rules are fully reflected.
Similarly, the growth and importance of federal laws, with their impact
on matters that were traditionally state or local in nature, is evidenced
with a considerable number of new entries and citations covering
federal acts, agencies, departments and courts. Likewise, the ever
expanding importance of financial terminology has necessitated the
inclusion of numerous new tax, finance, and accounting terms.

    Examples of word usages, with citations, have been added through­
out to illustrate how specific terms are used or applied in various legal
contexts.

                                  PREFACE

     Because of the inter-relationship of so many legal words and terms,
the number of internal cross-references has been greatly increased.
The number of abbreviation entries has also been substantially expand­
ed, as has the Table of Abbreviations.
    A number of changes have been made to the pronunciation guides
to make this feature even more helpful. A comprehensive explanation
of these guides is set forth on pages vii-xiv with a shorter pronuncia­
tion Key appearing on the inside front cover.
     New and revised words and terms for this Sixth Edition were
prepared by Joseph R. Nolan, Associate Justice, Massachusetts Su­
preme Judicial Court, and Jacqueline M. Nolan-Haley of Fordham
University School of Law.      The pronunciation transcription system and
guides were prepared by M.J. Connolly, Associate Professor of Linguis­
tics, Boston College.     Words and terms of the United Kingdom were
revised and updated by Professor Stephen C. Hicks, Suffolk University
Law School.       Tax and accounting terms were updated and expanded by
Martina N. Alibrandi, Certified Public Accountant, Bolton, Massachu­
setts.

                         A Final Word of Caution

     The language of the law is ever-changing as the courts, Congress,
state legislatures, and administrative agencies continue to define, rede­
fine and expand legal words and terms.           Furthermore, many legal
terms are subject to variations from state to state and again can differ
under federal laws.     Also, the type of legal issue, dispute, or transaction
involved can affect a given definition usage.          Accordingly, a legal
dictionary should only be used as a CCstarting point" for definitions.
Additional research should follow for state or federal variations, for
further or later court interpretations, and for specific applications.
Helpful sources for supplemental research are CCWords and Phrases"
and WESTLAW.

            THE PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN


    A majority of the Latin terms in this revised edition of Black's Law
Dictionary, and also occasional English and foreign terms, have been provid­
ed with pronunciation entries.        The pronunciations follow a descriptive
scheme and are based on actual usage rather than on any attempt to
prescribe a uniform pronunciation.        Where alternate pronunciations exist
and philologically more cappropriate' pronunciation generally receives first
listing, however.        The entries provide an acceptable pronunciation in a
transcription system compatible with the major varieties of North American
English and extendable to other pronunciations.
    Despite its continuing decline as a working language of scholarship and
jurisprudence, Latin still supplies a formidable stock of legal terms and
phrases.    The ability to use a Latin phrase correctly and pronounce it with
authority and consistency belongs to the equipment of a well-rounded jurist.
Those who actually study Latin today, however, will in all probability learn
a pronunciation (either the reformed philological or the Italianate) at vari­
ance with the Anglo-Latin system which prevails in legal and medical
spheres.    Injection of the cnewer' school pronunciations actually serves to
increase confusion and uncertainty:       Where masculine plural alumni and
feminine plural alumnae were once differentiated in speech as / �lamnay/
and /�lamniy/ respectively, one widespread variant of the philological pro­
nunciation actually reverses the opposition with masculine / �lamniy/ and
feminine / �lamnay/.       The status of amicus curiae, traditionally pronounced
/ �mayk�s kyuriyiy/, now has variants I�miyk�s kuriyayI (adapted philologi­
cal), lamiykus kuriyeyl (Italianate), and numerous hybrids.      A parliamenta­
rian of the old school, perhaps even well versed in Latin, adjourns a meeting
sine die / sayniy dayiyI only to have a junior colleague suggest that the
ccorrect' pronunciation is / siyney diyeyI.
    Strictly speaking, of course, any attempt at ccorrect' pronunciations of
foreign terms can at best be only weak approximations.            The linguistic
contortions of a purist attempting to weave foreign sounds and intonations
into the texture of an English sentence usually strike us as pedantic or
affected.   Although Julius Caesar may have pronounced his name something
like Iyuwliyus kaysar/ and later Romans may have called him Icheyzar/,
few speakers of English have place for anything other than the Anglo-Latin
I juwl(i)y�s siyz�r/ .
     Three major systems of Latin pronunciation, outlined below, coexist in
the English-speaking world.        Each has its proper cultural and scholarly
context.    The reformed (or new, or philological, or Roman) pronunciation
represents a modification to English speech habits of the reconstructed
sounds of Latin as it must have been in the classical period.       Philologists,

                                         PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN

classical historians, and most teachers of Latin employ this pronunciation in
their professional activity. Anglo-Latin (or English) pronunciation, the form
most commonly encountered in law, medicine, the natural sciences, and in
general usage, reflects the centuries of sound change that English has
undergone. *             Although it may not possess the authenticity of linguistic
reconstruction, the Anglo-Latin system enjoys the authority of a persevering
and distinct cultural tradition. The Italianate pronunciation derives from
the pronunciation of Later Latin and is viewed as the standard in Roman
Catholicism (including canon law), in music, in art history, and in medieval
studies.         Thus, a school master may leave the classroom, where he has just
taught his pupils Latin imperatives including wenite tcome' /weniyte/ (re­
formed philological), go to chapel to rehearse with the choir Psalm 95 in
Anglican morning prayer, the Venite /vanaytiy/ (Anglo-Latin), and then
actually sing the text in a Latin setting as /veyniytey eksulteymus . 1         .   .



(Italianate).           Each pronunciation is correct in its own context.

•   There exist, in addition, various secondary pronunciations,
such as the continental one often used by scholars of Middle
English literature and history.

    Attested forms in Anglo-Latin pronunciation sometimes fail to correspond
in qualitative or accentual details with the forms we might expect on an
etymological or systematic basis. Thus,
      bona fide appears as /b6wn� faydiy/ instead of               *   /b6n� fidiy/
      industry appears as /ind�striy/ instead of          *   /ind�striy/
      minor appears as /mayn�r/ instead of          *   /min�r/, etc.
Numerous developments in the sound system of English have tended to
override the expected forms. Analogies with sibling or quasi-sibling forms
often keep doublets flourishing side by side:
      licet �it is permitted' as /lays�t/ (cf. license) or /lis�tI (cf. licit)
      debet �one must' as /diyb�t/ or /deb�t/ (cf. debit and credit)
      capias �thou shouldst seize' as /keypiy�s/ (cf. cape) or /kcEpiy�s/ (cf.
          capture)
Language traditions usually resolve such conflicts in good time, favoring
�usage' over �correctness', and then promptly create new conflicts.

                   TRANSCRIPTION SYSTEM


    The transcription system employed for these listings is derived from one
of the traditional phonemic analyses of American English (Trager-Smith).
The values of the symbols vary with context, i.e., their specific pronuncia­
tions depend on the nature of the surrounding sounds. The pronunciation
habits of a normal speaker of English will, however, in practically all cases
supply the accustomed variants for that speaker's usage if the elements
presented in the key are substituted in accordance with the sample indica­
tions.    This system enables the speakers of a range of dialects to use one and
the same transcription and yet produce a pronunciation natural to their
speech.     For this reason, in addition to the considerations given above
concerning the treatment of foreign terms in English, sounds foreign to
English have been represented by the customary English substitutes.          Thus,
for example, the voiceless velar fricative of German Bach would be rendered
with a simple stop Ikl and French front rounded eu with Iyuw/.Readers
who wish to affect the foreign sounds will find guidance in their own
linguistic experience or in the appropirate grammars and dictionaries.
Similarly, readers who prefer pronunciations closer to the spelling than
those presented here should feel free to substitute their preferences, e.g.,
restoration of ufull" vowels for unaccented I�I or evert to pronouncing the t
in often.   Finally, readers who already feel secure (or even superior) in their
own renderings of words and phrases should retain these.         The editors will
always appreciate information on local variants and will welcome sugges­
tions for improving the transcriptions.
    The rubrics (sets of examples) under any given major symbol should
always be applied in order.       The earlier, more specific contexts take prefer­
ence over the later, telsewhere' variant.
    The special symbols
     1001 (ash)      IC51 (edh)     I�I (schwa)   IIJI (angma) (81 (theta)
appear respectively after
    lal          Idl                lei           Inl           ItI
    The reader will, of course, be aware that the transcription symbols do
not necessarily have the same alphabetic values as in English.        Rather, the
symbols must be viewed as arbitrary signs, although in many cases their
forms will aid the user in remembering and associating the key sounds and
symbols.
