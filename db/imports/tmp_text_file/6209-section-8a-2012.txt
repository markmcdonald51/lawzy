2     Transaction Codes

Transaction Codes (TC) consist of three digits. They are used to identify a transaction being processed and to maintain a
history of actions posted to a taxpayer’s account on the Master File. Every transaction processed by ADP must contain a
Transaction Code to maintain Accounting Controls of debits and credits, to cause the computer at ECC to post the
transaction on the Master File, to permit compilation of reports, and to identify the transaction when a transcript is
extracted from the Master File. Transaction codes that are unique to IDRS are also included.

The definitions of several transaction codes are necessarily changed since there will be no resequencing, offsetting, or
computer generated interest. In addition, all refunds will be scheduled manually with the refunds posted to the IMF using
TC 840.

Refer to Handbook 2.24.1 for obsolete transaction codes.

Refer to Section 13.06 for pending transaction and merged related codes.

Reversal Codes

An “R” following the transaction code indicates the transaction has been reversed.

The Reversal Code indicates the transaction has been reversed. Its valid values are "0", indicating no reversal and "1"
indicating a reversal. An 'R' following the transaction code display indicates the transaction has been reversed.

IMF Payment or penalty transaction codes ending with a transaction code of “3” which are NOT LISTED in this section are
actually reversed transactions which originally ended with a transaction code of "0". For programming purposes, the “0” in
the third position of the transaction code has been converted to “3” to indicate the original payment or penalty transactions
(or portion of it) which has been reversed. However, for account analysis purposes, those IMF payment/penalty
transaction codes ending with a “3” which are NOT LISTED in this section should be treated as transactions which have
been reversed (reversal code = "1")."

3      MF and IDRS Collection Status Codes

The Master File codes are MCC computer generated as a result of the computer analysis after a transaction has posted to
the Master File. The Status Code designates the current collection status of the module and will appear on the MCC
transcripts and on IDRS. The ten-digit abbreviations appear on the MCC transcripts only. IDRS Status Codes which are
unique to IDRS or vary in meaning from similar MF status codes are identified by *.

4     Master File Freeze Codes and IDRS status 48

Master file processing uses alpha codes to identify specific conditions that are generated either systemically, during the
processing operation, or manually, through input of a transaction code. These alpha codes are commonly referred to as
“freeze” codes. This term is misleading since not all alpha codes indicate activity within a module or account is frozen.
Various IDRS conditions also affect the status of a module. Assessment/abatement actions, refunds, offsets, status
updates, issuance of TDA balance due notices or suspension of a CSED can be affected by these alpha codes or IDRS
conditions.

5    Restrictive Conditions

IDRS balance due processing identifies certain restrictive conditions which prohibit issuance of balance due notice and
TDA. If a restrictive condition exists on a tax module eligible for update to notice of TDA status, the module will not update
to the next status. It will be analyzed in the next processing cycle for issuance of the appropriate status.

     Note: These conditions must be taken into consideration when a command code or transaction code are input to
     reactivate the balance due notice/TDA routine. If any of the conditions below are present on a module/account,
     IDRS will not update the status or resume balance due notice/TDA issuance until all restrictive conditions are
     removed.

FR Codes are posted to the Entity Section of the Master File to identify the types of returns a taxpayer must file. They are
not to be confused with Mail Filing Requirement Codes (MFR) which are used to identify the types of forms the IRS must
mail to the taxpayer. The MFR codes follow the Quick Reference chart below.
