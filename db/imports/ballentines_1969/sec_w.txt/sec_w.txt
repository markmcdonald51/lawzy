varying the terms of a contract. Lenoir Memorial Hospital, Inc. v Stared, 263 NC 630, 139 SE2d 901.

The national defense is an absolute necessity of our existence. The people of the United States have prepared
themselves for such a situation by confiding to Congress the power to declare war and to support and maintain armies for the
national defense. This is necessarily a master power, to be exercised without the hampering interference of anyone. The call of
men to the colors is within and necessarily within, the exercise of this power; To whom the call goes out, and who is to make an
answering response are matters germane to, and indeed necessarily involved in, the exercise of the war-making power.
Questions which necessarily arise, or may be expected to arise, must be determined in some way and by some tribunal. The
warmaking power may therefore provide the required system and constitute the needed tribunals. Local Draft Board No. I v

Ohio St 163, 16 NE2d 256, 119 ALR 1236.

certain situation exists or will continue, which diminishes the likelihood that the event insured against will occur; and hence "war-
ranty" and "condition precedent" are often used interchangeably. Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc.

R. H. Dana, in his Dictionary of Sea Terms defines the word as "a certain portion of a ship's company, appointed to

to command each." The men are divided as equally as possible with reference to their qualities as able seamen. The customary
watch is of four hours' duration, alternating between the starboard and the larboard or port watches. O'Hara v Luckenbach S.S

The word is in its very nature loose and indefinite in meaning, and the law cannot supply this defect by giving a definition,
because it is not a technical term of the law, and because the nature of a watchman's functions vary in different places and
according to the dangers to which the property is exposed, and even according to the nature and value of the property. Anno:
87 ALR 1114.
water. The liquid substance formed by the combination of hydrogen and oxygen represented by the symbol H2O.
While water is to be defined as a mineral, the rules of law as to its use must logically vary from those applicable to coal, ore, and
the like. It is a fluid, and mobile, "a fugitive," while coal and ores have a permanent place. The analogy to natural gas and oil is
more apt. Their natural use, however, is as merchandise. Water, although in a large measure a commodity of commerce, is
essential to the natural use of land for agriculture and other purposes, and to the support of human life itself. See Erickson v

wilful failure or refusal to perform a duty required by statute imports, not only the mere exercise of the will in failing to comply
with the statute, but also an intention to do an act that he knows, or ought to know, is wrongful or forbidden by law, and
involves the idea of premeditation and determination to do such act. 58 Am J1st Workm Comp § 203.
It has been said that "wilfulness", as used in the Federal internal revenue statutes imposing criminal penalties, includes
some element of evil motive and want of justification in view of the financial circumstances of the taxpayer, and as used in
statutes imposing civil penalties it may, while often connoting a bad purpose, be used to characterize an act which is intentional,
or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental. Paddock v Siemonet, 147 Tex 571, 218 SW2d 428, 7 ALR2d
1062.

just cause or excuse. Anno: 13 ALR2d 170; 9 Am .12d Bankr § 786.
A misappropriation of partnership funds by a

wilful and wanton misconduct. A deliberate and intentional wrong. Antonen v Swanson, 74 SD 1, 48 NW2d 161, 28 ALR2d
I (phrase in statute respecting liability of motorist for injury to guest).
Under a statute which imposes liability on the driver of a car for injury to a guest-passenger only where occasioned by
the driver's "wilful or wanton misconduct", such a disposition or mental state is shown by a person when, notwithstanding his
conscious and timely knowledge of an approach to an unusual danger and of common probability of injury to others, he
proceeds into the presence of danger with indifference to consequences and with absence of all care. Rodney v Staman, 37 1
Pa 1, 89 A2d 313, 32 ALR2d 976.
See wanton act.
wilful and wanton negligence. A paradoxical expression, since the adjectives imply premeditation or consciousness of danger

of another by failing, after discovering the peril, to exercise ordinary care to prevent the impending injury. Hinkle v Minneapolis,
A. & C. R. Co. 162 Minn 112, 202 NW 340, 41 ALR 1377.

Iowa 418, 239 NW 93, 81 ALR 483.
This word when used in a criminal statute generally means an act done with a bad purpose, or without justifiable excuse,
or stubbornly, obstinately, perversely, and is also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for believing it is lawful,
or conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act. United States v Murdock, 290 US 389, 78
L Ed 381, 54 S Ct 223.
wilfully and knowingly. A term characterizing the offense of obstruction of highway.
Some courts hold that a person may be guilty of 'wilfully and knowingly" obstructing a public road where he actively
participates in the doing of the act which results in the obstruction, even though he does not know that the place obstructed is le-
gally a public road, while others take the view that one cannot be deemed guilty of "wilfully" obstructing such a road where he
acts under the bona fide belief that no public road exists at the place where the obstruction is placed. 25 Am J1st High § 326.

See unlawfully; wilfully.
wilfully false. Fraudulent. Made with actual intent to mislead. 29 Am J Rev ed Ins § 721.
See wilful misstatement.
wilfully misapply. Not the equivalent of embezzle.
As the expression is used in an embezzlement statute making it an offense wilfully to misapply funds, the words have no
settled technical meaning, such as the word "embezzle" has in the statutes or the words "steal, take, and carry away" have at
common law, and they do not of themselves describe any offense. Batchelor v United States, 156 US 426, 429, 39 L Ed 478,
479, 15 S Ct 446.
wilful misconduct. Deliberate disobedience of the law, inclusive of acts of omission as well as acts of commission. The

ALR2d 729. Such conduct as manifests a disposition to perversity, and under such surrounding circumstances and existing con-
[1371]
ditions that the party doing the act or failing to act must be conscious from his knowledge of such circumstances and conditions
that his conduct will in all common probability result in injury. Universal Concrete Pipe Co. v Bassett, 130 Ohio St 567, 200
NE 843, 119 ALR 646.
The expression means something different from and more than negligence, however gross. There must be actual
knowledge, or that which in the law is esteemed to be the equivalent of actual knowledge, of the peril to be apprehended from
the failure to act, coupled with the conscious failure to act to the end of averting injury. Helme v Great Western Milling Co. 13
Cal App 416, 185 P 510.
Wilful misconduct depends upon facts of the particular case and necessarily involves deliberate, intentional, or wanton
conduct in doing or omitting to perform acts, with knowledge or appreciation of the fact on the part of the culpable person that
danger is likely to result therefrom. Cowgill v Bones, 189 Or 282, 218 P2d 445, 19 ALR2d 405.

intentional, not by accident or inadvertence. 39 Am J1st P & C § 107.
See neglect of child.
wilful negligence. A paradoxical expression, since "negligence" conveys the idea of inadvertence, but apparently signifying an
act done or omitted in such reckless disregard of the security and safety of another as to imply bad faith. 52 Am J1st Torts §
23.
wilfulness. See wilful.
wilful refusal. A refusal that is both intentional and unreasonable. Vermilye v Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. 205 Mass 598, 91
NE 904.

One who knowingly and wilfully encroaches or enters upon the land of another and takes his minerals without color or

ambulatory and revocable during his lifetime. A legal declaration of a man's intention, which he wills to be performed after his
death; the just sentence of the testator's wishes concerning what he would have done after his death. 57 Am J1st Wills § 2.
The term includes every kind of testamentary act taking effect from the mind of the testator and manifested by an
instrument in writing executed and attested in conformity to the statute. In fact, in some jurisdictions, there is a recognized
privilege of nuncupation under which, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, a will may be made without the execution of
a written instrument by the testator. 57 Am J1st Wills § 2.

skin or mucous membrane of the body, whereby animal venom or virus, or some impute, poisonous, or irritating matter, may
gain entrance to the underlying tissues and contaminate the blood. Fidelity and Casualty Co. v Thompson (CA8 Colo) 154 F
484, 487. An injury to the body of' a person or animal, especially one caused by violence, by which the continuity of the
covering, as skin, mucous membrane, or conjunctivea, is broken. Anno: 117 ALR 767. A lesion of the body. A hurt, loss, or
injury, or any morbid change in the structure of organs or parts of the body. 29A Am J Rev ed Ins § 1173. As the term appears
in an application for life insurance: -an injury to the body causing an impairment of health or strength, or rendering the person
more liable to contract disease, or less able to resist its effects. Bancroft v Home Beneficial Asso. 120 NY 14, 23 NE 997.
The Supreme Court of Illinois defines the word as meaning a lesion of the body and defines lesion as a hurt, loss. or
injury. Hence, that court's definition excludes the necessity of a breaking or cutting of the skin and is broad enough to include an
injury to the subcutaneous tissue and to the skin, which has resulted from carbon monoxide poisoning and is revealed by scarlet
blotches. Warbende v Prudential Ins. Co. (CA7 111) 97 172d 749.
Ordinarily, whether or not a particular injury constitutes a wound, within the meaning of statutes relating to wounding
with intent to maim, seems to depend upon whether there is a complete sever-
[1379]
ance or breakage of the skin. From an early date, the word wound in such a statute has been construed to mean that there must
be a breaking of the skin. This breaking must consist in the separation of the whole skin; a separation of the cuticle or upper skin
only, or the fact that one's skin is bruised where struck by a stick, is not sufficient. Similarly, a scratch does not constitute a
wound within the provisions of a maiming statute. A disruption or breaking of the internal skin or membrane, however, as that
within the mouth or the membrane lining the urethra, will suffice. 36 Am J1st May § 5.
wounded feelings. Distress from insults, indignity, or humiliation. 22 Am J2d Damg § 237.

ALR 1327. Noun: A ship which, in consequence of injuries received, is rendered unnavigable, or unable to pursue her voyage,
without repairs exceeding the half of her value. 48 Am J1st Ship § 647 - Such goods as after a shipwreck are cast upon land by
the sea, and left there. 48 Am J1st Ship § 647. A person in very poor physical condition. A dowdy woman.
Under the Federal income tax law, allowing deduction for loss caused by shipwreck, in computing net income, the word
does not mean complete loss; damage to the ship suffices. Nor need such damage be caused by storm or natural causes. A
wreck through collision is within the act, whether due to the negligence of the other vessel or of employees of the wrecked ship.
See Shearer v Anderson (CA2 NY) 16 F2d 995, 51 ALR 534.

Am J2d B & N § 57. The expression of ideas by visible letters.
It may be on paper, wood, stone, or other material. The ten commandments were written with the finger of God on
tables of stone: Exodus xxxi, 18. The general rule undoubtedly is that whenever a statute or usage requires a writing, it must be
made on paper or parchment; but it is not necessary that it be in ink. It may be in pencil. Numerous authorities sustain this view,
as applied to contracts and promissory notes. A prudent man will not write his will in pencil, but it is valid if he does so. Myers v
Vanderbilt, 84 Pa 510.
A Missouri statute defines the term "written instrument" as including every instrument, partly printed and partly written,
or wholly printed with a written signature thereto. State v Carragin, 210 Mo 351, 109 SW 553.

As used in section 8, of the first article of the Federal Constitution conferring upon Congress the power to secure to
authors the exclusive right to their respective "writings," the word means the literary productions of those authors, and Congress
[1380]
has declared these to include all forms of writing, printing, engraving, etching, etc., by which the ideas in the mind of the author
are given visible expression. 18 Am J2d Copyr § 35.

writ of attachment. A writ, otherwise known as a warrant or order of attachment, issued at or near the beginning of a suit, the
object of which is to seize and hold property of the defendant subject to the claim upon which suit is brought for the ultimate

writ of entry ad terminum qui praeteriit. A writ of entry for the term which has passed.
A common-law writ which lay for an owner who deemed it more expedient to admit that his tenant at sufferance had
gained a tortious freehold, than to oust him by actual entry, as he had a lawful right to do. See 3 Bl Comm 175.

origin, the purpose of which was originally to prevent waste, after judgment obtained in any action real and before possession
delivered.
Its scope was enlarged by the Statute of Gloucester (6 Edward 1, ch. 13) to include cases of waste pending suit and to
extend the writ to cases in which no recovery of land was sought. It was not only a preventive remedy, but was remedial and
corrective, because the holder of land might Dot only be prevented from doing waste, but if he should do any, notwithstanding
the prohibition, the plaintiff might recover damages for such waste, even up to the time when possession should be delivered to
him. See 56 Am J1st Waste § 30.

demanded. 28 Am J Rev ed Inj § 2.
writ of inquest. See writ of inquiry.
writ of inquiry. A writ for the assessment of damages by the sheriff and a jury.
Our courts possess the same power to assess damages as a jury in England upon a writ of inquiry, issued to the sheriff
for that purpose. There, in these cases, the court must issue a writ to the sheriff, commanding him by twelve men to inquire into
the damages and make return to the court; which process is called a writ of inquiry. The sheriff sits as judge, and there is a
regular trial by twelve jurors to assess the damages. Lennon v Rawitzer, 57 Conn 583, 584, 19 A 334.

suggestion of the relator, the court is informed he is about to do. Better defined as a writ to prevent a tribunal possessing judicial
or quasi-judicial powers from exercising jurisdiction over matters not within its cognizance, or exceeding its jurisdiction in
matters of which it has cognizance. 42 Am J1st Prohib § 2.
writ of prohibition of waste. A common-law writ, which anciently lay for the owner of the inheritance against the commission
of waste by a tenant in dower, or by the curtesy, or a guardian in chivalry, which issued out of chancery, was directed to the
sheriff and commanded him to prevent waste from being committed, and in the execution of which the sheriff might, if necessary,
call to his aid the posse comitatus.
Subsequently the scope of the writ was so enlarged as to make it available for the purpose of preventing waste by a
tenant for life or for years. See 56 Am J1st Waste § 30.
writ of pro retorno habendo. A writ issued in an action of replevin upon the entry of a judgment for the defendant, com-
manding the return to the defendant of property taken from him under the writ of replevin.

& E § 1001.
writ of review. A writ which is substantially the common-law writ of certiorari and is denominated in the codes a "special
proceeding."
The return to the writ brings up the record of the inferior court, officer, of tribunal, not for the purpose of ascertaining an
issue of' fact, but to determine whether or not the functions of the court, officer, or tribunal have been exercised erroneously, or
that the jurisdiction employed has been exceeded. The only inquiry to be considered upon the return to the writ is a question of
law, in the examination of which the parties are not entitled to a jury trial, thus taking the proceedings out of the reason usually
assigned of excluding equitable jurisdiction. Hall v Dunn, 52 Or 475, 97 P 811.
writ of right. An ancient writ for the recovery of real property wrongfully withheld from the owner.
The term was also applied to that class of writs which the sovereign was bound by Magna Charta to issue, and which

ALR 1. In common usage, an act in violation of a moral principle.
The word, as the word "injury," in law imports the invasion of a legal right, and to say that a person has committed a
wrong, is to say that he has subjected himself to a cause of action. See Eller v Carolina & N. W. R. Co. 140 NC 140, 52 SE
305.
Sometimes that may be right in law which is otherwise from a moral standpoint, since there is no wrong in legal
contemplation as to that upon which the law's instrumentalities have set the seal of right. Laun v Kipp, 155 Wis 347, 145 NW
183, 5 ALR 655.
As the word was used by the fathers of the common law in their saying that for every "wrong" there should be a remedy,
they meant a violation of the municipal law, the law of civil conduct, not a transgression of the divine law, as such, nor a breach
of etiquette. Western Union Tel. Co. v Ferguson, 157 Ind 64, 60 NE 674.
Under a statutory test to the effect that a person is not excused from liability as an idiot, imbecile, lunatic, or insane
person, except upon proof that at the time of committing the alleged criminal act, he was laboring under such a defect of reason
as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or not to know that the act was wrong, the word "wrong" does
not always and necessarily mean legal wrong, although it sometimes includes such a wrong. People v Schmidt, 216 NY 324,
110 NE 945.
wrongdoer. One who commits a wrong against another. A tortfeasor.
wrongful. Unlawful, inequitable, contrary to natural justice, or in violation of the principles of good morals. Board of Comrs. v

J1st Suret § 336.
wrongful act. Any act which in the ordinary course will infringe upon the rights of another to his dam-
[1383]
age, unless it is done in the exercise of an equal or superior right. Brennan v United Hatters of North America, 73 NJL 729,65
A 165; Louis Kamm, Inc. v Flink, 113 NJL 582, 175 A 62, 99 ALR I.
The words are comprehensive enough to include negligent acts, but they are intended primarily to cover cases where the
act was wanton or was intentionally committed, or where one may have counseled or procured another to do it, when, in
contemplation of law, the act of counseling or advising makes the wrongful act his own. See Foreman v Taylor Coal Co. 112
Ky 845, 66 SW 1044.
wrongful attachment. Wrongfully obtaining or tortiously employing an order for, or writ, of attachment, as where no ground
for attachment exists, where property of the defendant not liable to attachment is seized, or where property of a third person is

attachment, an action for abuse of process, or a suit for malicious prosecution. 6 Am J2d Attach § 596.

wrongful distress. A distress which is unlawful and actionable, as where there was no rent in arrears, or where acts rendering
the landlord a trespasser ab initio are committed in making the levy, or where a second distress is barred by a prior distress, or
where the distress is excessive and a sale is made under it. See 32 Am J1st L & T § 645.
wrongful execution. An actionable wrong predicated upon irregular procedure, irregularity in the judgment upon which the writ
was obtained, the doing of an act outside the authority conferred by the writ, an improper seizure of property, a wrongful sale,
or the enforcement of an execution in violation of an injunction. 30 Am J2d Exec §§ 755 et seq.
See wrongful levy.
wrongful garnishment. Improperly obtaining or tortiously employing the remedy of garnishment. A wrong akin to wrongful

grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or not supported by substantial evidence. Anno: 10 L Ed 2d 1217.
