the act ratified. A county board could not ratify a subscription without a vote of the county because they could not make a sub-

Some confusion has arisen as to the use of the word "ratified," and as to whether ratification is a fact or a conclusion of
law arising from the facts. As the term is applied to principal and agent it is a fact and not a legal conclusion, but when it is used
in a sense akin to estoppel, it is a conclusion of law. Minnich v Darling, 8 Ind App 539, 544, 36 NE 173.

This maxim of the Roman law has been changed to "Ratihabitio mandato aequiparatur" (Ratification is equivalent to a
command), ever since the days of Lord Coke. It has never been doubted that a man's subsequent agreement to a trespass done
in his name and for his benefit amounts to a command so far as to make him answerable. Dempsey v Chambers, 154 Mass
330, 28 NE 279.
ratihabition. Same as ratification.
Ratihabitio priori mandato aequiparatur. A ratification is equivalent to a previous command. "A maxim borrowed from the

To realize means to bring into actual possession. It is ordinarily used in contrast to hope, or anticipation. A man may

it, and realization is not deemed to occur until the income is paid. But the decisions and regulations have consistently recognized
that receipt in cash or property is not the only characteristic of realization of income to a taxpayer on the cash receipts basis.
Where the taxpayer does not receive payment in money or property, realization may occur when the last step is taken by which
he obtains the fruition of the economic gain which has already accrued to him. Helvering v Horst, 311 US 112, 85 L Ed 75, 61

record and will treat as the real party him whose interests are involved in the litigation. Gibson v Solomon, 136 Ohio St 101, 16
Ohio Ops 36, 23 NE2d 996, 125 ALR 903.

which are not annexed to the person or cannot be moved from the place in which they subsist. 42 Am J1st Prop § 13. In a
strictly technical sense, such an interest as one has in land; a right, interest, or ownership, existing in the soil, and consisting of an
estate in fee or for life. Callihan v Martin, 3 Cal 2d 110, 43 P2d 788, 101 ALR 871.

reason. The ability to think and draw conclusions. Cause; justification. Good sense; good judgment.
Lawyers are copious in their encomiums on the reason of the common law. They tell us that the common law is the
perfection of reason; that it always intends to conform thereto, and that what is not reason is not law. But every particular reason
of every rule in the law cannot at this distance of time be precisely accounted for, and it is sufficient that there be nothing flatly
contradictory to reason, and then the law will presume it to be well founded. See 1 Bl Comm 70.
See by reason of.
reasonable. Not extreme. Not arbitrary, capricious, or confiscatory. Public Service Com, v Haverneyer, 296 US 506, 80 L
Ed 357, 56 S Ct 360.
"What is reasonable depends upon a variety of considerations and circumstances. It is an elastic term which is of
uncertain value in a definition." Sussex Land & Live Stock Co. v Midwest Refining Co. (CA8 Wyo) 294 F 597, 34 ALR 249,
257.
reasonable basis in law. See rational basis.

110 Ala 92, 20 So 365.

reasonable diligence. A relative term. Diligence as required by the circumstances of the case. 38 Am J1st Negl § 29.

watchful care and the most active diligence; anything short of this is negligence and carelessness. Stanley v Steele, 77 Conn 688,
60 A 640.
See reasonable time.
reasonable doubt. As militating against the sufficiency of the evidence:--an actual and substantial doubt of the defendant's guilt
arising from the evidence, or from a want of evidence, as distinguished
[1061]
from a vague apprehension. A fair doubt based upon reason and common sense and growing out of the testimony in the case. A
doubt arising from a candid and impartial investigation of all the evidence, being such as, in an ordinary transaction of life, would
cause a reasonable and prudent man to hesitate and pause. That state of mind which, after a fair comparison and consideration
of all the evidence in the case, both for the state and for the defense, leaves the minds of the jury in such a condition that they
cannot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge. Saunders v State, 4 Okla Crim 264,
111 P 965.
As a reason for a decision in favor of the constitutionality of a statute or municipal ordinance:- -want of certainty that the statute

among other things, to the size of the place, the extent of the demand for transportation, the cost of furnishing the additional
accommodations asked for, arid all other facts which would have a hearing upon the questions of convenience and use. Atlantic

The meaning of the term as contemplated by a provision of a bill of lading that claims for loss, in case of failure to

evidence of the discharge of an obligation.
No receipt can have the effect of destroying per
[1064]
se any subsisting right; it is only evidence of a fact. It is not a release. A receipt "in full," however, given knowingly and without
fraud, has been accorded the conclusive effect of a formal release, but such cases are usually those of compromise of disputed
claims or receipts for unliquidated damages. Ryan v Ward, 48 NY 204.
A mere receipt for money does not import a promise, obligation, or liability and hence is not within the statute of
limitations governing contracts, but if it recites that the money received is to be applied to the account of the person from whom
it was received, it partakes of both a receipt and a contract and becomes subject to the statute of limitations applicable to
contracts. 34 Am J1st Lim Ac § 85.

Commissioner v Williston, 315 Mass 638, 54 NE2d 43, 151 ALR 1395.
As the words "receive" and "accept" are used in the statute of frauds, the authorities generally agree that they do not
mean the same thing, although they are ordinarily synonymous. To "receive" seems to imply taking into possession by the buyer,
while "accept" means an assumption of' ownership oil the part of the buyer, treating the goods as his own. Mack Co. v Bear
River Milling Co. 63 Utah 565, 227 P 1033, 36 ALR 643, 646.
In computing income taxes, although there is authority to the contrary, the general view is that where a dividend is
declared in one year, but not paid or payable to the stockholder until a subsequent year, it is "received" and taxable in thelatter
rather than the earlier year. But actual receipt is not necessary, and a dividend may be in which it was constructively received by
being made unqualifiedly subject to his demand. Anno: 120 ALR 1282.
received. See receive; value received.

recent. New or fairly new. Characterizing the period of time immediately preceding the present moment.
In the law of larceny, under the rule that the possession of stolen property must be recent after the theft in order to
afford a just basis for an inference of guilt on the part of the possessor, the word “recent" in this connection is incapable of exact
definition. Except perhaps in extreme cases, no definite time can be fixed as to when, as a matter of law, possession is or is not
recent. What is recent possession varies, within a limited range, with the conditions and surrounding circumstances of each case,
arid is, within such range, to be determined by the jury upon the facts of the particular case. The particular period of time
involved is an important element to be considered, but it is not the only one. The circumstances and character of the goods, their
salability, and whether they are cumbersome or easily portable, are also among the factors to be considered, 32 Am J1st Larc §
142.
"We think that 'recent transactions' to which this Court has declared a tax law may be retroactively applied, Cooper v
United States, 280 US 409, 411, 74 L Ed 516, 50 Sup Ct Rep 164, must be taken to include the receipt of income during the
year of the legislative session preceding that of its enactment." Welch v Henry, 305 US 134, 83 L Ed 87, 59 S Ct 121.
recently. Lately.
As the word is used in connection with the probative value of evidence that stolen goods were recently in the possession of the
defendant, it refers to the defendant's possession soon after the theft anid not to possession immediately before prosecution. See
State N Wiley, 53 Mont 84, 164 P 84.
Possession of the fruits of crime recently after its commission justifies the inference that the possession is guilty
possession, and though only prima facie evidence of guilt, may be of controlling weight unless explained by the circumstances or
accounted for in some way consistent with innocence. Wilson v United States, 162 US 613, 619, 40 L Ed 1090, 1095, 16 S
Ct 895.

reduction to practice. The completion of a discovery by putting the product thereof, an invention, to use or practice. 40 Am
J1st Pat § 27.
In patent interference proceedings, the law pertaining to a successful reduction to practice is not satisfied by
demonstrations which indicate that if subjected to a practical test a device might work, but rather requires the submission of
evidence establishing that the device was subjected to a practical test and that it did, in fact work. Jacke v Long, 27 Cust & Pat
App 1147, 111 F2d 184.
It is academic that the question of what constitutes reduction to practice in the sense of the patent laws may depend in a
large part on the inherent nature of the article under scrutiny, together with the consideration of the use for which it is designed.

fish was ever caught with a rod embodying the invention. Heddon v Cowdery, 26 Cast & Pat App 743, 100 F2d 426.

lawful for the feoffor and his heirs to re-enter, if the rent be behind, the feoffor or lessor may enter into the lands and hold them

As employed in a provision permitting persons “related to" a member of a benefit society to be named as beneficiaries in

47 NJ Eq 563, 22 A 1055.

power. 41 Am J1st Pow § 70. The principle that the recording of an instrument is deemed in law to have been done on the day

relatione. See ex relatione.
relation of debtor and creditor. See debtor and creditor relation.
relation of physician and patient. See physician and patient.

When used in wills, the word is ordinarily construed as including relatives by consanguinity, and excluding relatives by
affinity, unless a contrary intention is manifested. The term "relations" or "blood relations" in wills generally means such persons
as take under the statute regarding the distribution of estates of intestates, but it may include those who actually are related by
blood although they could not inherit from him because of the disqualification of illegitimacy. 57 Am J1st Wills § 1391.
As to who are "relations" with the meaning of an anti-lapse statute, see Anne: 19 ALR 2d 1159; 57 Am J1st Wills §
1442.
See degrees of kinship; industrial relations; relatives.

If on this appeal the approver is successful, he receives pardon; if he is not successful he is convicted upon his
confession, that is, upon his testimony against himself. State v Willis, 71 Conn 293, 309, 41 A 820.
relative convenience doctrine. The principle that upon an application for injunction, the court shall consider and weigh the
relative convenience and inconvenience and the comparative injuries to the parties and to the public which would result from the
granting or refusal of the injunction sought, the essential concept being that the court is not bound to make a decree which will
do more mischief and wreak greater injury than the wrong which it is asked to redress. 28 Am J Rev ed Inj § 52.

trustee in bankruptcy:-persons related to the bankrupt by affinity or consanguinity within the third degree, as determined by the
common law, and the spouse of the bankrupt. Bankruptcy Act § 1(27); 11 USC § 1(27).
The word "relatives" when used in a contract has no such fixed and definite meaning as will thwart the express intention
of a party thereto. Bennett v Van Riper, 47 NJ Eq 563, 22 A 1055.
The rule is quite universal in the state jurisdictions that the word embraces the persons who would take under a statute
of distribution and descent in case of intestacy. Thus, by virtue of the right to take under the statute of distribution and descent in
New York, an illegitimate child and its mother are not only relatives, but are parent and child within the meaning of the statute.
See Middleton v Luckenbach S.S. Co. (CA2 NY) 70 F2d 326.

suit. Anno: 28 ALR 15, 16. A discharge from duty or from confinement as a prisoner.
When the word "released" is stamped or written across the face of a bill of lading, it signifies that the carrier is exempt
from his common-law liability as an insurer. Morganton Mfg. Co. v Ohio River & Charleston Ry. Co. 121 NC 514, 28 SE
474.

6 Am J2d Attach § 523; 30 Am J2d Exec § 277. A bond given to obtain the release of property under levy by releasing it, not
merely from the custody of the officer who made the levy, but from the lien of the levy. 6 Am J2d Attach § 523, 30 Am J2d
Exec §§ 277, 280.
release by estoppel. A release executed by a party under such circumstances that he is precluded by his own negligence from
asserting that it is not legal and binding upon him; as where a person who signed a release could read it and did not although he
had full opportunity to do so before signing it. Wallace v Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway Co. 67 Iowa 547,
549.
release by way of enlarging an estate. See release deed.
release by way of passing an estate. See release deed.
release deed. A deed of quitclaim. 23 Am J2d Deeds § 16.
Formerly, the term seems to have been applied only to deeds conveying all the right, title and interest of the grantor to a
grantee who already had some estate in possession in the land released, but in modern usage it is not one of the essentials of a
release deed that the grantee shall already have some right, title or interest in the property released. The term is therefore now
synonymous with the term quitclaim deed. Anno: 44 ALR 1269.
Blackstone calls such a conveyance a "release" and says that releases may inure either by way of enlarging an estate; as
where a life tenant receives a release of all his right from a remainderman, thus giving the life tenant an estate in fee; or releases
may be by way of passing an estate; as where one of two coparceners releases all her right to the other, thus passing a fee
simple of the whole. See 2 Bl Comm 324.

release of debt. See release.
release of dower. The extinguishment of a wife's inchoate right of dower by due execution of a formal release as part of the
spouse's deed of conveyance or encumbrance, or through a joint conveyance by husband and wife, duly executed and
acknowledged. 25 Am J2d Dow § 115.
release of expectancy. The assignment of the expectancy of an heir apparent, either to his ancestor or to another potential heir
or distributee. 23 Am J2d Desc & D § 165.
release rate. A rate charged by a carrier which is less than the regular rate but operating to release or
[1085]
reduce the liability of the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods in transit.
Neither the marking of a bill of lading, "released," nor the making of a "release rate" will have the legal effect of releasing
or reducing the liability of the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods, where no effort was made to place or fix a valuation of
the goods when shipped, although the shipper understood that the "release rate" was lower when the bill of lading was marked
"released." See Central of Georgia Railroad Co. v Hall, 124 Ga 322, 52 SE 679.

probable or improbable, according to the common course of events. People v Nitzberg, 287 NY 183, 754, 38 NE2d 490, 40
NE2d 40, 138 ALR 1253; Barnett v State, 104 Ohio St 298, 135 NE 647, 27 ALR 351; Masterson v Harris County Houston
Ship Dist. (Tex) 15 SW2d 1011.

adversary to perform as directed or to refrain from specified conduct. As defined in the Federal Administrative Procedure
Act:-the whole or part of any agency (1) grant of money, assistance, license, authority, exemption, exception, privilege or
remedy; (2) recognition of any claim, right, immunity, privilege, exemption, or exception; or (3) taking any other action upon the
application or petition of, and beneficial to, any person. 5 USC § 1001(f). Public aid to persons who are destitute and unable to
support and maintain themselves. 41 Am J1st Poor L §§ 13 et seq.
Anciently called "relevium,” --an incident to every feudal tenure, by way of fine or composition with the lord for taking
up the estate, which was lapsed or fallen in by the death of the last tenant. Although reliefs originated while feuds were only life
estates, they continued after feuds became hereditary, and hence were justly regarded as one of the heaviest grievances of
tenure; especially when they were, as at first, merely arbitrary and at the will of the lord; so that if he demanded an exorbitant
relief, the heir was disinherited. See 2 Bl Comm 65.
"The relation of the heriot to the relief has been one of the chief battle-fields on which the fight of different theories of the
early law has been waged. The date of the origin of the heriot has been material only as bearing upon this; and most of those
who have studied the subject do not doubt their identity, or at least that it was upon the plan of the heriots that the Norman
Conqueror fashioned his plan of relief, as Blackstone says." (Cf. 2 Bl Comm 423.) See Hammond's Blackstone.

A delusion that the act charged as a crime was one commanded by God has been held a defense on the ground that,
under such circumstances, the defendant could not have known that the act was wrong, although he may have known that it was
illegal. There is some authority, however, that knowledge that the act was in violation of law is a sufficient predicate for
responsibility and therefore for denying the defense. 21 Am J2d Crim L § 41.

Okla Crim 40, 130 P 510.

prohibiting the disturbance of any assemblage met for religious worship. 24 Am J2d Disturb M § 2.
religious men. Men who lived in monasteries; monks.
religious principles. Those sentiments, concerning the relations between God and man, which may influence human conduct.
Of these, perhaps the most influential hitherto has been the view entertained as to the probability that God would punish
vice. A person's sentiments on that subject, whether of belief, disbelief, or doubt, must be deemed part of his religious princi-
ples. Percey v Powers, 51 NJL 432, 17 A 969.
religious purpose. The advancement of religion. The propagation of the faith. Maintaining religious worship.
An association formed for the purpose of exercising some ecclesiastical control over its members, or prescribing some
form of worship for them, or subjecting those of its members who fail to conform to its rules to ecclesiastical discipline, is
formed for a "religious purpose." But a Young Men's Christian Association formed to promote growth in grace and Christian
fellowship among its members, and aggressive Christian work, especially by and for young men, and to seek out and aid the
worthy poor, is not formed for a "religious purpose." Hamsher v Hamsher, 132 Ill 273, 23 NE 1123.

ex rel. Weiss v District Board of School Dist. 76 Wis 177, 44 NW 967. A denomination of religious persons having a common

place for the worship of God and for religious instruction. Anno: 17 ALR 1063, s. 28 ALR 864, 81 ALR 1184. More
elaborately, a voluntary organization whose members are associated together not only for religious exercises, also for the
purposes of maintaining and supporting its ministry, providing the conveniences of a church home, and promoting the growth and
efficiency of the work of the main church body of which it forms a coordinate part. First Presbyterian Church v Dennis, 178
Iowa 1352, 161 NW 183.
This term as it is used in the contemplation of a constitutional provision providing for exemption from taxation is to be
taken in its ordinary acceptation as meaning an association or body of communicants or a church usually meeting in some stated
place for worship or for instruction, or organized for the accomplishment of religious purposes, such as instruction or
dissemination of some tenet or particular faith or otherwise furthering its teaching. Mordecai F. Ham Evangelistic Asso. v

remainder. An estate, whether in real or personal property, limited to take effect in possession immediately after the expiration
of a prior estate known as the particular estate, created at the same time and by the same instrument. 28 Am J2d Est § 195.
The word is relative and implies a prior disposition of some part of the estate, but the particular estate and the remainder
constitute one whole, are carved out of the same inheritance, and may both vest at the same time and subsist together. Moore v
McKinley, 246 Iowa 734, 69 NW2d 73.
The essence of a remainder is that it is to arise immediately on the determination of the particular estate by lapse of time
or other determinate event, and not in abridgement of it. 28 Am J2d Est § 196.
Though, strictly speaking, a remainder is not the same as reversion, the term "remainder," as used in a particular statute,
such as the income tax law, may be construed to include what, in a strict common-law sense, is a "reversion." Commissioner of
Corp. & Taxation v Bullard, 313 Mass 72, 46 NE2d 557, 146 ALR 772.
See alternative remainders; contingent remainder.
remainder after remainder. A permissible limitation where the remainders are in the alternative so that one takes effect if the

remainderman. One entitled to an estate in remainder.
Under a statute providing that as respects the passing and limitation over of real or personal property dependent, under
the terms of any instrument, on the foster parent dying without heirs, the minor adopted child is not deemed the child of the
foster parent so as to defeat the rights of remaindermen, the term "remaindermen" was held to include all those persons who
might ultimately be entitled to take the estate, whether they were technically remaindermen under the definition of the common
law or otherwise. Re Leask, 197 NY 193, 90 NE 652.
See remainder.
remainders on a contingency with a double aspect. Alternative remainders so limited that the second takes effect in lieu of
the first, and only in case the first never takes effect at all. 28 Am J2d Est § 216.
As an illustration, a limitation to A for life, and after A's death, if he have children, to them in fee simple, and if he have
no children, then to B in fee simple. In such case, in one alternative the remainder in favor of the children vests, and in the other
alternative the remainder in favor of B vests. First Nat. Bank v Pointer, 174 Tenn 472, 126 SW2d 335.
remainder on a double contingency. See remainders on a contingency with a double aspect.

Boston Steel & Iron Co. v Steller, 183 Mass 140, 66 NE 646.
The doctrine that where a mail has a right to lands, but is out of possession, afterward has a freehold cast upon him by
some subsequent defective title, and enters by virtue of that title, in such case he is remitted, or sent back, by operation of law,
to his ancient and more certain title.
The right of entry, which he gained by a bad title, is ipso facto annexed to his own inherent good title; and his defeasible
estate is utterly defeated and annulled, by the instantaneous act of the law, without his participation or consent. See 3 Bl Comm
19.

remnant theory. A theory sometimes applied in determining the amount of property subject to condemnation under the power

will be required to pay for the whole, notwithstanding it only took a part. Cincinnati v Vester (CA6 Okla) 33 F2d 242, 68 ALR
831, affd 281 US 439, 74 L Ed 950, 50 S CI 360.
remonstrance. A protest. An objection. An objection, for example, to the establishment of a highway. 25 Am J1st High § 25.

the court. Mahoney v Beatman, 110 Conn 184, 147 A 762, 66 ALR 1121.
If two distinct causes are successive and unrelated in their operation, they cannot be concurrent. One of them must be
the proximate and the other the remote cause, and the law will regard the proximate as the efficient and responsible cause,
disregarding the remote cause. 38 Am J1st Negl § 67.
remote damages. Damages from an injury not occurring directly from and as a natural result of the wrong complained of;
damages of an unusual and speculative nature. Braun v Craven, 175 Ill 401, 51 NE 657.
As a legal ground for the exclusion of damage in a tort action, "remoteness" means, not severance in point of time, but
the absence of defect and natural causal sequence-- the inability to trace in regard to the damage the propter hoc in a necessary
or natural descent from the wrongful act. See Dulieu v White & Sons, 2 K. B. (Eng.) 669, 17 Times L. R. 555.

See move.
removal for cause. The removal of a public officer from office for reasons which the law and sound public policy recognize as
sufficient warrant for removal, that is, legal cause, not merely cause which the appointing power in the exercise of discretion may
deem sufficient. 43 Am J1st Pub Of § 205,
removal from office. Divesting an incumbent of the powers and emoluments of office. An incident of the sovereign power
which creates an office, the title to office being held subject to the conditions imposed by the sovereign power in constitution or
statute. 43 Am J1st Pub Of §§ 181, 182. The divesting of the power, authority, and position of a person as an executor or
administrator of a decedent's estate. 31 Am J Ex & Ad § 109.
As used in a constitutional provision providing that an officer unless "removed" holds office until his successor qualifies,
the word refers to ouster from office under the statute authorizing removals for misconduct, and does not refer to ouster by quo
warranto proceedings, which are invoked only where a person is usurping an office to which he has no legal title. See Haymaker
v State ex rel. McCain, 22 NM 400, 163 P 248.
Removal from office also applies to corporate officers, removal being accomplished as provided for and regulated by
statute or provision of the charter of the corporation. 19 Am J2d Corp § 1105.

renewal note. A new promissory note given by way of renewing the obligation under a prior note.
As applied to promissory notes, in commercial and legal parlance, the word "renewal" or "renewed" means more than

invention as the right to obtain a patent. 40 Am J1st Pat § 103.
renewal of policy. The continuance of insurance in force by the payment of a new premium, sometimes under a provision for
renewal contained in the contract of insurance.
A renewal of insurance by the payment of a new premium and the issuance of a receipt therefor, where there is no
provision in the policy for its renewal, is a new contract on the same terms as the old, but where the renewal is in pursuance of a
provision to that effect, it is not a new contract but an extension of the old. 29 Am J Rev ed Ins § 357.
See renewable insurance.

All the lands in the kingdom of Spain were divided into "territoria." The "territorium" was divided into "proprios,"
"solares," "ejidos," “pastos," "dehesas," and "monte." The "proprios" belonged to the town as its proper severalty. The "solares"
belonged to their respective owners in severalty. The residue of the "territorium"-"ejidos," "pastos," and "dehesas"-was the com-
[1094]
munity property of the members of the community. When the necessity ceased, the system was changed and about the time of
the discovery of America (1492). It was determined to reduce these community lands to private ownership. This was done
through various officers and commissioners of the government. The act was never called or characterized as a grant or a
concession, but as a partition among the owners of common property, giving to each his share in severalty. This act was called
"repartiamento." Steinbach v Moore, 30 Cal 498, 501.

repeated. Reiterated. Told as heard, as where a slanderous statement is told to a third person by the person to whom it was

represent. To state as a fact. To act for. To stand in the place of.
The proceeds of an insurance policy stand to the owner in the place of the property lost; it is the value of the house paid

existing system or plant by an equivalent one is final as determining the new or present value of a public service property, but
both may be of evidential effect in determining the actual fair value thereof. 43 Am J1st Pub Util § 113.
re propria. See in re propria.
republic. A country with a republican form of government.
republican form of government. A government constructed on the principle that the supreme power resides in the body of the

republication. The repetition of a slanderous statement by the person to whom it was originally communicated. 33 Am J1st L
& S § 95. A publication of a will previously altered or revoked. 57 Am J1st Wills § 625.
Ordinarily, when a codicil is said to "republish" a will, it is meant that a will, then valid, is republished as of the date of
the codicil. Anno: 33 ALR2d 929.
Prior to the statute of frauds, a will devising real property could be republished by parol in the same manner as a will
bequeathing personalty, but since the enactment of the statute of frauds and the statute of wills a revoked will cannot be revived
by an oral declaration of the testator, or otherwise than by a re-execution or republication or by a codicil. Where a statute
makes no provision for a republication, but simply requires that in the original execution and publication of the will certain
solemnities must be observed relative to the signing of the will by the testator and by subscribing witnesses, the weight of
authority and the better rule is that the republication must be made with like solemnity as the execution of the original will and an
oral republication is insufficient; nor can the republication be shown by mere parol evidence. 57 Am J1st Wills § 625.
republication of will. See republication.

material facts. 27 Am J1st Indict § 110; 41 Am J1st PI § 47.
In pleading, the common-law doctrine of repugnancy relates to inconsistent matters of substance which are alleged in the
same count or plea. Counts and pleas, however, which are merely inconsistent with one another are not for that reason
repugnant in a legal sense. 41 Am J1st PI § 48.
[1098]
repugnancy doctrine. A doctrine stated in reference to the construction of repugnant provisions in a will that the law favors the
first taker; that the first taker in a will is presumed to be the favorite of the testator; that an absolute gift in a will cannot be cut
down by subsequent inconsistent language of doubtful or ambiguous significance, it being necessary before such a result will be
permitted that the language indicating an intention to cut down the gift be as clear, plain, and unequivocal as that used in the gift
itself; that the presumption is that the first taker receives a fee in spite of subsequent words casting doubt on such result; that in
case of doubt as to the quantity of an estate devised, the general rule is that an absolute rather than a qualified estate was
intended; and that where a devise of an absolute interest is made, subsequent limitations attempting to deprive the estate of any
of the incidents appertaining to it are repugnant and void. 57 Am J1st Wills § 1320.
repugnant allegations. See repugnancy.
repugnant provisions. Inconsistent provisions, as in a deed or will. 23 Am J2d Deeds §§ 237-239, 250, 267.
See repugnancy doctrine.

reputable. In good repute. Worthy of repute.
The term as used in a statute authorizing the registration of any person who was a reputable resident physician of good moral
character, who on the first day of July 1897 was engaged in the actual practice of medicine within the state, was construed as
referring to any person who is regarded as honorable and praiseworthy as a member of the medical profession, of whatever
school, or whether classed with any particular school, by any reason of the character of his work and his conduct professionally
and not limited to physicians and surgeons who are graduates from some reputable medical school, or belonged to some
incorporated medical society. Anno: 4 ALR2d 685.

request. To ask or express a wish for something. Philomath College v Wyatt, 27 Or 390, 31 P 206, 216. Sometimes to direct
or command, although in a delicate manner. In other words, a precatory word, subject to construction in a proper case as a
mandatory term. Coulson v Alpaugh, 163 111298, 45 NE 216; Shaver v Weddington, 247 Ky 248, 56 SW2d 980.
Under some circumstances, a request is the same as a command and has the same meaning. A request from a person in
authority is understood to be a mere euphemism. It is in fact a command in an inoffensive form. See State ex rel. Freeman v
Scheve, 65 Neb 853, 91 NW 846.
The words "request," "hope," "not doubting," that the executor will conduct in a specified manner, when they come from
a testator who has power to command, are to be construed as commands in his will, clothed merely in the language of civility,
and they impose on the executor a duty which courts have in repeated instances enforced. Pembroke Academy v Epsom
School Dist. 75 NIT 408, 75 A 100.
The word may be employed in a will as an entreaty, depending upon the context in which the word is inserted and the
circumstances attendant upon its use. Marx v Rice, 1 NJ 574, 65 A2d 48, 9 ALR2d 584.

request note. A notice to a person having dutiable goods in his possession, requiring him to secure a permit for their removal.
require. To need-, to call for: to make necessary; to demand. 17 Am J2d Contr § 281; 46 Am J1st Sales § 135.
The word is derived from the Latin "require," compounded of "re" and "quiro"-to seek for, or to seek to get back.
Although it may undoubtedly be used in the sense of the word "need," that is neither its primary nor its usual signification. Ac-
cording to all the lexicographers, and in common parlance, it means to command; to ask by right and by authority. Duhamel v
Port Angeles Stone Co. 59 Wash 171, 176, 109 P 597.
When used in a statute the word "required" may be equivalent to the word "commanded;" as where commissioners were
by statute not only authorized, but "required" to levy a yearly tax. Taylor v Commissioners of Newberne, 55 NC (2 Jones Eq)
141.
required. See require.
required medical treatment. Necessary medical treatment. Scott v State, 90 Tex Crim 100, 233 SW 1097, 16 ALR 1420.
requirement contract. A contract which calls for the one party to furnish all of the supply of a certain material required for the
operation of the business of the other party for a prescribed time, and for the latter to purchase all of such required supply from
the former. 28 Am J Rev ed Inj § 121.
The essence of a requirements contract is that the amount of the commodity needed by the purchaser cannot be exactly
defined at the beginning of the year and it is for this reason that a contract of this type which deals for future needs is entered
into. William C. Atwater Co. v Terminal Coal Corporation (DC Mass) 32 F Supp 178.
[1099]
requirements of the business. As a designation of quantity of goods purchased:-the quantity which is actually needed in the
buyer's business as distinguished from the quantity ordered or desired by the buyer, provided there is good faith and no fraud.
46 Am J1st Sales § 158.
Under an agreement to fill the buyer's requirements, the obligations of the parties are governed by the needs of the
business even though those needs increase or decrease because of varying conditions to which the business is ordinarily subject,
for such conditions may be said to be within the contemplation of the parties. Loudenback Fertilizer Co. v Tennessee Phosphate
Co. (CA6 Tenn) 121 F 298.
requisition. An authoritative demand, for example, the demand of the government for military supplies. The taking of private
property for use by the government in the waging of a war. International Paper Co. v United States, 282 US 399, 75 L Ed 410,
51 S Ct 176. A substitute for a writ of replevin in some jurisdictions, accomplishing the same purpose, although subscribed and
issued by plaintiff's attorney. 46 Am J I st Replev § 79.
A request issued by the President of the United States as the chief executive of the Federal Government, requiring a
quota or detachment of militia to be furnished or held in readiness for the service of the United States. A requisition, which is a

status quo. Anno: 94 ALR 1240.
Treating a contract as broken and desisting from further performance, where the other party to the contract has been
guilty of a breach of it, is an abandonment of the contract, but it is not a "rescission" technically speaking. It is merely the accept-
ance of the situation which the wrongdoing of the other party has brought about. Anvil Mining Co v Humble, 153 US 540, 552,
39 L Ed 814, 818, 14 S Ct 876.
As the word is applied to contracts, to "rescind" in some cases means to terminate the contract as to future transactions,

22 NYS 371.

rescissory action. An action to rescind a contract or other written instrument.
res communes. (Roman law,) Things which are common property.
The human race having multiplied, men partitioned among themselves the earth and the greater part of those things which
were on its surface. That which fell to each one among them commenced to belong to him in private ownership, and this process
is the origin of the right of property. Some things, however, did not enter into this division, and remain therefore to this day in the
condition of the ancient and negative community. 'These are the things which the jurisconsults called "res communes." Among
them are the air, the water which runs in the rivers and the sea. Wild animals, ferae naturae, have also remained in the ancient

rescue them or take them from him, he shall have the writ of rescous." See Newell v Clark, 46 NJL 363, 376.

residuary clause. A clause in a will which purports to dispose of that part of the estate which is left after other legacies and
devises have been paid and all legal claims against the estate discharged. 57 Am J1st Wills § 1415.
The term seems to contemplate the former provisions in the will to carry into effect the wishes of the testator as to the
disposition of his estate, and is used to cover all that remains after such former dispositions of property have been carried out.
Morgan v Huggins (CC Ga) 48 F 3, 5.
The phrase "rest, residue, and remainder" is frequently used in wills to devise and bequeath all of the property of the
testator which he has not by his will specifically devised or bequeathed. " 'All the rest, residue, and remainder of my property,
both real and personal,' expresses no intent to limit or exclude from the residuum anything personal or real, anything whatever
which for any reason might prove to be ineffectually disposed of. It expresses a clear intent on the part of the testator to make a
full and complete disposition of his property." Wilson v Sanger, 57 App Div 320, 322, 68 NYS 30.
As a rule, an enumeration of specific articles in a residuary clause will not make the bequest specific as to such articles
unless they are designated in such a way as to differentiate them from the residue. A bequest of all a man's personal property is
a residuary and not a specific legacy, since its import is the same as is expressed by the words, "rest and residue." But a devise
of "all the residue of the testator's real estate and personal property not hereinbefore enumerated, as hereinafter described," is a
specific bequest of the subsequently enumerated property, and does not entitle the beneficiary to take as a residuary legatee the
lapsed legacies and property not enumerated in the bequest to him. 57 Am J1st Wills §§ 1415 et seq.
residuary devise. See residuary clause; residuary gift.
residuary devisee. One favored by a residuary devise.

public office with intent accompanied by an act of relinquishment. 43 Am J1st Pub Of § 165. To give up, to give back the office
with intent to relinquish it.
A prospective resignation may, in point of law, amount but to a notice of intention to resign, since it is not accompanied
by a giving up of the office; possession is still retained and may not necessarily be surrendered till the expiration of the legal term
of the office, because the officer may recall his resignation,-may withdraw his proposition to resign. State ex rel. Ryan v
Murphy, 30 Nev 409, 97 P 39 1, 720.

strangers. Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad Co. v Schmitz, 211 Ill 446, 456, 71 NE 1050.
The recitals of an instrument are not ordinarily admissible against third persons as proof of the facts recited, being as to
them res inter alios acta. 29 Am J2d Ev § 841.
Res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet. Transactions between certain parties ought not to prejudice third parties.
"The general rule is that a person's books of account cannot be used as evidence upon issues between third persons,
that entries in such books as to such third persons are res inter alios acta, and cannot be used against persons not parties to
them." State ex rel. Pabst Brewing Co. v Carpenter, 129 Wis 180, 108 NW 641.
Res inter alios judicatae nullum aliis praejudicium faciunt. (Civil law.) Matters which are adjudged as between certain
persons effect no prejudice as to others; matters determined in a case do not prejudice those not parties thereto.
res ipsa loquitur. The thing speaks for itself. The rule that proof that the thing which caused the injury to the plaintiff was under
the control and management of the defendant, and that the occurrence was such as in the ordinary course of things would not
have happened if those who had its control or management had used proper care, affords sufficient evidence, or, as sometimes
stated by the courts, reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the injury arose from, or was
caused by, the defendant's want of care. 38 Am J1st Negl § 295.
The three essential elements of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur are: (1) the instrumentality must be under the control or
management of the defendant; (2) the circumstances, according to common knowledge and experience, must create a clear in-
ference that the accident would not have happened if the defendant had not been negligent; and (3) the plaintiff's injury must
have resulted from the accident. Lewis v Wolk, 312 Ky 536, 228 SW2d 432, 16 ALR2d 974.
The term means "the thing speaks for itself," and that means the thing or instrumentality involved speaks for itself. It
clearly does not mean the accident speaks for itself. It means that when the initial fact, namely what thing or instrumentality
caused the accident has been shown then, and not before, an inference arises that the injury or damage occurred by reason of
the negligence of the party who had it under his exclusive control. The inference of negligence arising from the initially established
fact
[1105]
compels the defendant, in order to relieve himself of liability, to move forward with his proof to rebut the inference of negligence.
Travelers Ins. Co. v Hulme, 168 Kan 483, 213 P2d 645, 16 ALR2d 793.
resist. To make resistance.
resistance. Opposition by direct, active, forcible, or quasi-forcible means. State v Welch, 37 Wis 196, 201. The criminal
offense in resisting orders issued by lawful authority. 39 Am J1st Obst J § 5.
resisting officer. A criminal offense at common law and also by force of statute in resisting a public officer in the performance
of his duties or opposing him by interposing obstacles or impediments to hinder, impede, or prevent him from performing his
duties. 39 Am J1st Obst J §§ 8 et seq.
Under a statute penalizing under the single term “resist," it is not enough that the performance of a duty is opposed,
obstructed, interrupted, hindered, or prevented; the officer must be resisted, and the resistance must be active and direct toward
him. 39 Am J1st Obst J § 8.
res judicata. Literally, the thing has been decided, been adjudicated. State v Wear, 145 Mo 162, 192, 46 SW 1099. The
principle that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits, without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent
jurisdiction, is conclusive of rights, questions, and facts in issue, as to the parties and their privies, in all other actions in the same
or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction. 30A Am J Rev ed Judgm § 324.
The effect of a judgment as res judicata appears in at least three aspects, viz. merger of cause of action, bar, and
estoppel. Anno: 49 ALR2d 1038.
A difference exists between the effect of a judgment as a bar to a second action between the same parties upon the
same claim or demand and its effect in another action upon a different cause of action; in the former case, the judgment on the
merits constitutes an absolute bar to the second action, being a finality, not only as to every matter which was offered and
received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but also as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for
that purpose; in the latter case, the judgment is a bar only as to the matters actually litigated and determined in the former action,
and not as to what might have been litigated and determined therein. Smith v Smith, 235 Minn 412, 51 NW2d 276, 32 ALR2d
1135.

See res derelicta.

resolution. An expression of the opinion or mind of a municipal counsel concerning some matter of administration and providing

"Mr. Justice Story (I Story, Const § 880) has well said that the practical construction of the Constitution and the history
of the constitutional provision in question (article 1, section 7) Proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict
sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue." Twin City Nat. Bank v Nebeker,
167 US 196, 202, 42 L Ed 134, 136, 17 S Ct 766.

Constitution "to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises." California ex rel. McColgan v Bruce (CA9 Nev) 129 F2d
421, 147 ALR 782.
As the term is used in connection with the jurisdiction of the United States Courts, it means a law imposing duties on
imports or tonnage, or a law providing in terms for revenue; that is, a law which is directly traceable to the power granted to
Congress by section 8 of article I of the Federal Constitution, "to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises." United
States v Hill, 123 US 681, 31 L Ed 275, 8 S Ct 308.
A law passed for the purpose of authorizing the levy and collection of taxes in some form. The term does not include
laws which are passed for other purposes although they may incidentally create revenue. The National Prohibition Act, passed
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment, is not a revenue law. United States v McConnell
(DC Pal 10 F2d 973.
See Internal Revenue Code.
revenue officers. Officers of the United States for the administration and enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code.
See Internal Revenue Service.
revenue stamps. The means of collecting many of the taxes imposed by the federal government, the requirement of the law

entered by the court below. 5 Am J2d A & E § 948.
As the word is used in connection with judgments, its usual meaning contemplates only a reversal by an appellate court;
that is, by any court authorized to set aside the judgment. See Manfull v Graham, 55 Neb 645, 649.
reverse. See reversal.
reverse bars. Angle irons curved in the reverse arc to the frames of a steel or iron ship and fastened with one flat side against
one side of the projecting flange of the frames, strengthening the hull of the vessel and constituting a part of it. The President

of the outstanding leasehold estate. 32 Am J1st L & T § 76. An estate in praesenti, vested in the sense of a present fixed right of
enjoyment in futuro. Norman v Horton, 344 Mo 290, 126 SW2d 187, 125 ALR 531; an estate dependent in respect of
possession on the determination of the particular estate granted or devised. Metcalfe v Miller, 96 Mich 459, 56 NW 16.
A reversion may exist, under the view taken in some jurisdictions, as a repository for the "fee" or "inheritance" to be
taken under ultimate contingent interests during the pendency of present interests. For instance, a reversion is sometimes stated
to exist where an ultimate remainder in fee is contingent. Until it vests, there is a reversion in the grantor or devisor and his heirs.
28 Am J2d Est § 173.
The words "revert" and "reversion" are sometimes loosely used to describe an interest different from a reversion in the
true sense of the term. A reversion does not become a remainder or a remainder a reversion because it is so called in the instru-
ment creating it. The words should be construed in the light of the intent of the testator or grantor. Brown v Guthery, 190 NC
822, 130 SE 836.

necessary to bring the code up to date.
revision. Looking over a thing, such as an article or a schedule of public utility rates, and reviewing it carefully for the purpose
of making changes, additions, and corrections, if such be deemed advisable. Goodwin v Prime, 92 Me 355, 363, 42 A 785.
In local assessment proceedings, the words “revision" and "correction" refer to the fact that the board may be called
upon to review that which has been done, and to make the proceedings conform to the law. Hutcheson v Storrie, 92 Tex 685,
51 SW 848.
To revise is to review or re-examine for correction, and when applied to a statute, the word contemplates the
re-examination of the same subject matter contained in the prior statute, and the substitution of a new, and what is believed to
be, a still more perfect rule. Casey v Harried, 5 Iowa 1.
revival. Restoration of strength. Restoration to a condition of activity.
revival of action. The procedure by which a proper party, personal representative, heir, distributee, legatee, or devisee, is

264 P2d 944, 42 ALR2d 1162. A procedure at common law and under some statutes by writ of scire facias but more
commonly under modern statutes, by motion. 1 Am J2d Abat & R § 117.
The revival is not a new suit; it is still the same suit, in which both parties are entitled to the benefit of all former
proceedings. Havens v Seashore Land Co. 57 NJ Eq 142, 149, 41 A 755.
revival of cause. The revival of a cause of action barred by the statute of limitations. 34 Am J1st Lim Ac §§ 289-336.
According to the weight of authority in this country, the term "revived cause of action" has two distinct meanings. One
refers to a cause of action barred by the statute of limitations, and brought to life again in the manner provided by statute, as by
a new promise in writing signed by the debtor. The other meaning refers to a cause of action the statutory life of which has been
revived or restored in the same manner, but before the cause of action has become barred by the statute. Bullard v Lopez, 7
NM 561, 37 P 1103.
revival of corporation. The revival of corporate existence after expiration of the corporate charter, such being permissible only
as authorized by statute. 18 Am J2d Corp § 69. The revival of a dissolved corporation, as permitted by statute. 19 Am J2d

for the nonpayment of premiums, pursuant to a provision for reinstatetment contained in the policy and the performance of such
conditions as are imposed by such provision, or pursuant to the special agreement of the parties. 29 Am J Rev ed In,, § 368.
There is a difference of opinion whether the reinstatement of an insurance policy constitutes a new contract. 29 Am J
Rev ed Ins § 369.
revival of will. The act of a testator in giving testimentary effect to a will previously revoked by a new testamentary act in
re-executing or publishing the will. 57 Am J1st Wills § 615. Giving renewed effect to an earlier will previously revoked by a
later will by a still later will revoking the intermediate will. 57 Am J1st Wills § 619.
It is held in many cases that a revoked will or codicil can he revived by subsequent codicil. Anno: 33 ALR2d 925.
revive. To come back to the vigor of life. To bring back to the vigor of life. To effect a revival.
The primary meaning of the word is “to give life to again." If it is a creative act to give life to dead matter once, it is no
less a creative act to give life again to the same matter when it becomes dead.
The syllable "re" in the word indicates the use of old matter, and the syllable "vive" means "to give life to," which is one
of the primary meanings of the word "create." The quality of the act inheres in the giving of life, not in the material that is to be
vivified. Nor is the quality of the act changed by repetition. See Re Bank of Commerce v Wiltsie, 153 Ind 460, 53 NE 950.

revocation of probate. The rendition by a probate court of a decree vacating and annulling a prior decree admitting a will to

revocation of will. The annulment of a will, making it speak for nought in whole or in part, by a clause in a later valid will by an
inconsistent disposition of property in a later valid will or codicil, or by tearing, cutting, burning, obliterating, erasing and defacing
the instrument with intent to annul or cancel it. 57 Am J1st Wills §§ 455 et seq.
The revocation of a will consists of two things, -the intention of the testator, and some outward actor symbol of
destruction. A defacement, obliteration, or destruction, without the animo revocandi, is not sufficient. Neither is the intention -the
animo revocandi -sufficient without some act of obliteration or destruction. Cutler v Cutler, 130 NC 1, 40 SE 689.
The difference between a revocation and an alteration of a will is that if what is done simply takes away what was given
before, or a part of what was given before, then it is a revocation; but if it gives something in addition, or gives something else,
then it is more than revocation, and cannot be done by mere obliteration. When by obliteration of certain words a different
meaning is imparted, there is not a mere revocation. There is something more than the destruction of that which has been
antecedently done. There is a transmutation by which anew clause is created. See Miles' Appeal, 68 Conn 237, 36 A 39.

reward. A sum of money or other recompense offered by the government, a natural person, an association, or a corporation to
the members of the public generally, or to persons of a particular class, for the performance of a particular service, such as the
finding of a lost article of property, locating a missing person or a lost child, or the giving of information leading to the arrest of a
person for a crime recently committed, and paid to a person for the performance of such service in accord with the offer and the
conditions imposed in the offer. Zwolane v Becker Mfg. Co. 150 Wis 517, 137 NW 769.

case of a single service, which can be only once performed, and, therefore, will be earned only by the person or co-operating
persons who succeed while others fail, while the term bounty applies where the services or action of many persons are desired
and each who acts upon the offer may entitle himself to the promised gratuity without prejudice from or to the claims of others.

Royalty, when used in connection with a license under a patent, means the compensation paid by the licensee to the
licensor for the use of the licensor's patented invention. This is substantially Webster's definition except that the latter adds
"usually at a certain rate for each article manufactured, used, sold, or the like." The word rate itself does not define or designate
the "unit." There have been various units used in license contracts under patents such as "device manufactured," "period of use,"
or "device sold." Royalty provisions frequently provide for the payment of a fixed amount per device manufactured, sold, sold or
used, or for fixed payments per unit of time. Hazeltine Corporation v Zenith Radio Corp. (CA7 111) 100 F2d 10.

Eng Reprint 206, 234. In terms in which it is usually stated:-the principle that when a person takes an estate of freehold, legal or
equitable, under a deed, will, or other writing, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or
without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs or heirs of his body, as
a class of persons to take in succession from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole
estate. 28 Am J2d Est § 102. The rule that if one makes a limitation to another for life, with a remainder over mediately or
immediately to his heirs, or the heirs of his body, the heirs do not take remainders at all, but the word "heirs" is regarded as
