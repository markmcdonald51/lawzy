empty; to cease from occupying; to annul; to make void, express the different meanings which it has acquired. Originally it meant

In most of the states, there has been a departure in some particulars, even to a considerable extent, from the
common-law definition.
vagrant. One in a state of vagrancy; one guilty of vagrancy.
At common law, a vagrant was originally understood to be an idle person without visible means of support, who, though
able to work for his maintenance, refused to do so. The idea connected with the word "vagrant" or "vagrancy" also had con-
nected with it, and as a part of it, not only an idle person, but one whose business, pursuit, or occupation, or want of it, was
vicious to society, and one who loitered or stayed about immoral places. The English vagrant acts, as in effect defined by old
English statutes and referred to in 4 Bl Comm 169, also tended to show that this was the idea of a vagrant. Under modern
legislation in many states of the Union, vagrants are defined to be and are punished for pursuing a business or occupation or
profession of a vicious, illegal, or demoralizing tendency, and the idea conveyed and intended to be conveyed thereby was and
is as to the status, course of conduct, business, pursuit, or occupation of such persons who are denounced as vagrants, and
proven by showing many specific acts which make up their general course of conduct, status, business, pursuit, or occupation, in
contradistinction to their committing a specific act. The idea further is that such persons are denominated "vagrants" because
their course of conduct, status, business, pursuit, or occupation is habitual in its nature. Anne: 14 ALR 1483.

vain thing. See vain act.
vale. A beautiful word for a poet, meaning valley. (Spanish.) A promissory note.
Valeat quantum valere potest. Let it have effect to such extent as it can have effect.
The maxim is applicable to almost every legal transaction. In wills, the method of the courts has been not to set aside the

value received. A formalized recital of consideration without elaboration. 49 Am J1st Stat of F § 373.
As the expression is used in a promissory note, it does not necessarily import a consideration in money, and a promise
to pay may legally be the consideration, without any money passing. The consideration may be as varied as the transactions of
men. Not only does the phrase not necessarily import a consideration of money, but it does not conclusively import a
consideration of any kind; for it is competent, notwithstanding these words, to show that no consideration has been, in fact, re-
ceived. Osgood v Bringolf, 32 Iowa 265, 270.
The words as used in a written instrument, other than a negotiable or sealed instrument, have generally been held to
create a presumption, or make a prima facie case, of a sufficient consideration to support the instrument. Thus, the recital "value
received" in an assignment of a life insurance policy, being in the nature of an admission by the assignor of the receipt of a
consideration, creates a prima facie case that there was a sufficient consideration to make the assignment effective. Finegan v
Prudential Ins. Co. 300 Mass 147, 14 NE2d 172, 116 ALR 535.
See for value received; valuable consideration.

information and the proof as to some matter which is legally essential to the charge. State v Crean, 43 Mont 47, 114 P 603.

material unless it is such as might mislead the defense, or expose the defendant to the injury of being put twice in jeopardy for
the same offense. Brashears v State, 38 Okla Crim 175, 259 P 665.

ALR2d 960.
The term includes title, legal or equitable, to the present or future enforcement of a demand or a legal exemption from a
demand made by another, though it must be something more than such a mere expectation as may be based on an anticipated
continuance of general laws. Massa v Mastri, 125 Conn 144, 3 A2d 839, 120 ALR 939.
To be vested, a right must have become a title, legal or equitable, to the present or Future enjoyment of property, or to

governor of a state of the Union after the bill has passed both houses of the state legislature. The veto is essentially a legislative
act. The fact that the President or the governor is limited to negation or concurrence, and cannot affirmatively initiate or amend

School Trustees, 162 Ind 278, 284, 70 NE 264.
The Latin expression "vis major," or "force majeure," is not exactly the equivalent of an act of God. The test of "vis
major" is whether under the particular circumstances there was such an insuperable interference without the party's intervention
as could not have been prevented by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and care; and, unlike an act of God, it may consist, for
instance, of governmental intervention resulting from the necessities of war. 1 Am J2d Act of God § 4.

ALR 1002. Sometimes construed as "voidable." Hall v Baylous, 109 W Va 1, 153 SE 293, 69 ALR 527.
The words "to be void and of no effect" are often used in statutes and legal documents, such as deeds, leases, bonds,
mortgages and others, in the sense of voidable, merely, that is, capable of being avoided, and not as meaning that the act or
transaction is absolutely a nullity as if it never had existed, incapable of giving rise to any rights or obligations under any
circumstances. Thus we speak of conveyances, void as to creditors, meaning that creditors may avoid them, but not others.
Leases which contain a forfeiture of the lessee's estate for non-payment of rent, or breach of other condition, declare that on the
happening of the contingency the demise shall thereupon become null and void, meaning that the forfeiture may be enforced by
re-entry, at the option of the lessor. A deed obtained by fraud is sometimes said to be void, meaning that the party defrauded
may elect to treat it as void. Ewell v Daggs, 108 US 143, 149, 27 L Ed 682, 684, 2 S Ct 408.
A statutory provision that, in the absence of compliance therewith, a sale in bulk shall be "void" as against creditors of
the seller, means that the sale shall be voidable. Evans v Herbranson, 241 Iowa 268, 41 NW2d 113, 15 ALR2d 925.

avoided by a disaffirmance. Williston, Contracts 3d ed § 15; Restatement, Contracts § 113; 17 Am J2d Contr § 7.
The view of some authorities that an executory contract of an infant is invalid until confirmed has been adversely
criticized, and in some jurisdictions there are statutes to the effect that both executed and executory agreements of an infant are
valid until disaffirmed. 27 Am J1st Inf § 12.
voidable deed. An instrument which, although defective, is operative to convey the property until set aside by the court. 23 Am
J2d Deeds § 137.

to render the transfer voidable under insolvency laws. 29 Am J Rev ed lnsolv § 82. A transfer of property by one since
adjudicated a bankrupt which is subject to avoidance so as to permit the trustee in bankruptcy to recover for the estate the
assets thus transferred. 9 Am J2d Bankr §§ 1056 et seq.

want of jurisdiction is entitled to no respect whatever but may be entirely disregarded or declared inoperative by any court in
which effect is sought to be given to it. 30A Am J Rev ed Judgm § 45. A judgment which is an absolute nullity, so that its
invalidity may be asserted upon either direct or collateral attack by any person whose rights are affected, at any time and at any
place. Southern Surety Co. v Texas Oil Clearing House (Tex Corn App) 281 SW 1045, 1046.
void marriage. A marriage absolutely prohibited by law and not subject to ratification. A marriage which is expressly declared
a nullity ab initio by statute. 35 Am J1st Mar § 46.
void process. Process which is defective to the extent of being a nullity and not amendable, either because in violation of statute
which prohibits it or because it is not in substantial compliance with statutory requirements. 42 Am J1st Proc § 20. Such
process as the court has no power to award, or has not acquired jurisdiction to issue in the particular case, or which does not in
some material respect comply in form with the legal requisites of such process, or which loses its vitality in consequence of
noncompliance with a condition subsequent, obedience to which is rendered essential. Fischer v Langbein, 103 NY 84, 90, 8
NE 251.
void release. A release which is forged, prohibited by express statute, contrary to public policy, or given by one without power
to grant a release. 45 Am J1st Rel § 17.
void tax. A tax imposed without basis in law, as where the statute under which it is levied is unconstitutional or so indefinite,
uncertain, or inconsistent as to be entirely inoperative. 51 Am J1st Tax § 303. A tax which never had any effect, which never
created any lien or raised any obligation to pay.
A void tax is no tax. It is as if there never had been any attempt at assessment. The owner of property is under no duty,
either at law or in equity, to pay it. There is no equitable reason for requiring the owner to pay such a tax before a cloud upon
his title made by a tax sale shall be removed. Morrill v Lovett, 95 Me 165, 49 A 666.

determine competency. 58 Am J1st Witn § 211.

voiturier. (French.) Carrier. One engaged in transportation.
volatile estates. Movables of a solid cbaracter, such as tables and other heavy furniture. See 2 Bl Comm 428.
volens. Willing, but not necessarily wishing.
It is said in the Kambour Case, 77 NH at page 47, that "volens means wishing, not willing; and it by no means follows
from the fact that a person is willing to chance being injured, that he wishes, or even is willing to be injured." Whether volens
means wishing rather than willing may be questioned, but if one may be willing to chance being injured, he at least is willing to be
injured rather than not take the chance of it, for otherwise his action would not be taken. Smith v Twin State Gas & Electric Co.
83 NH 439, 61 ALR 1015, 144 A 57.
volenti non fit injuria. One is not legally injured if he has consented to the act complained of or was willing that it should occur.
Anno: 17 ALR2d 348, § 3. The maxim upon which the principal of assumption of risk is based. 35 Am J1st M & S § 293.
The maxim is frequently applied to a plaintiff who is complaining of a nuisance to which he voluntarily exposed himself.

him to see, he is willing to be deceived, and the maxim applies. 55 Am J1st V & P § 67.
volition. Choice or determination by one's own will.

Amount of space in cubic contents.
volumus. We will; we wish.
voluntarily. Freely. Of one's own accord.
When used in its ordinary sense, the word means "willingly," or "without compulsion," but it sometimes means more than
this; and whenever in order to make a statute effective it is necessary to construe the word "voluntarily" as implying knowledge,
it is the duty of the court to so construe it. Sweeney v Sweeney, 96 Vt 196, 118 A 882, 26 ALR 1066, 1067.
voluntarius daemon. A person who is voluntarily demented, a person who has become voluntarily intoxicated.

same, or the proceeds thereof, to the payment of his debts, and to return the surplus, if any, to the debtor. Farwell v Nilsson,
133 111 45, 49, 24 NE 74.

benevolent, protective, or mutual purposes, or to promote some public, scientific or educational object, or to facilitate business,

accepted into, membership as a matter of choice.
If membership is required by law, such as in the case of some public officers or employees, or if membership in a
professional society is necessary, in a substantial sense, for the practice of one's profession, such an organization is not
voluntary. 6 Am J2d Asso & C § 1.

voluntary expatriation. See expatriation.
voluntary exposure to danger. Intentionally doing some act which reasonable and ordinary prudence would pronounce
dangerous.
The approach to an unknown and unexpected danger does not make the act a voluntary exposure thereto. The result of
the act does not necessarily determine the motive which prompted the action. The act may be voluntary, yet the exposure may
be involuntary. The danger being unknown, the injury is accidental. Equitable Acci. Ins. Co. v Osborn, 90 Ala 201, 9 So 869.

voluntary manslaughter. A homicide, in which the act of killing, although intentional, is committed under the influence of
passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or reasonable provocation and before a reasonable time has elapsed for

recklessness of disposition. 26 Am J1st Homi § 19.

neglects to proceed to the trial of a case after it has been put in issue. 24 Am J2d Dism § 3. A nonsuit which is entered against a
plaintiff when he throws up his case and consents to a judgment in favor of the defendant for costs.
The plaintiff has the right to do this at any time before the jury retires, or if there is no jury, at any time before the

voluntary payment. A payment of an illegal demand, with a full knowledge of all the facts which render the demand illegal,
without an immediate and urgent necessity therefor, unless it is to release his person or property from detention or to prevent an
immediate seizure of his person or property.
A payment is not to be regarded as compulsory unless made to emancipate the person or property from an actual and
existing duress, imposed by the parties to whom the money is paid, and if a payment is otherwise voluntary, the fact that a
person making a payment files a written protest at the time does not change its character. 40 Am J1st Paym § 159.
In determining whether a payment of taxes was voluntary or involuntary the real question is whether there was such an
immediate and urgent necessity for the payment as to imply that it was made under compulsion. Without such an immediate and
urgent necessity, such a payment will be deemed voluntary. United States v New York & C. Mail S. S. Co. 200 US 488, 50 L
Ed 569, 26 S Ct 327.
A payment of taxes may be voluntary, although made unwillingly. Anno: 64 ALR 11, s. 84 ALR 294.
It is well established in the absence of statute that the right of a party who has paid a tax, local assessment, or license
fee, to recover the same back, depends upon whether or not the payment was voluntary. If the payment was voluntary it cannot
be recovered back; if it may be deemed involuntary a recovery may be had. A payment is voluntary in the sense that no action
lies to recover back the amount, not only where it is made willingly and without objection, but in all cases where there is no
compulsion or duress, or any necessity of making the payment as a means of saving the property from legal restraint or the grasp
of legal process. Anno: 84 ALR 294.
Where a taxpayer pays taxes before their payment can be enforced by distraint or the imposition .of other penalties,
such premature payment has been held to be a voluntary payment and therefore not recoverable, even though the taxes were
invalid. Canard S.S. Co. v Elting (CA2 NY) 97 F2d 373.
See volunteer.
voluntary payment of taxes. See voluntary payment.
voluntary peonage. An antithetical expression.
Peonage is sometimes classed as voluntary or involuntary, but this implies simply a difference in the mode of origin, none
in the character of the servitude. The one exists where the debtor voluntarily contracts to enter the service of his creditor. The
other is forced upon the &btor by some provision of law. But peonage, however created, is compulsory service,-involuntary
servitude. The peon can release himself therefrom, it is true, by the payment of the debt, but otherwise the service is enforced. A
clear distinction exists between peonage and the voluntary performance of labor or rendering of services in payment of a debt.
In the latter case the debtor, though contracting to pay his indebtedness by labor or service, and subject like any other con-
tractor to an action for damages for a breach of that contract, can elect at any time to break it, and no law or force compels
performance or a continuance of the service. Ex parte Hollman, 79 SC 9, 60 SE 19.
voluntary petition. A petition in bankruptcy wherein petitioner asks that he be adjudicated a bankrupt. 9 Am J2d Bankr §
207.
voluntary reorganization. The reorganization of a corporation by the voluntary action of the stockholders and creditors, or,
where statute permits, by the creditors and a prescribed percentage of the stockholders. 19 Am J2d Corp §§ 1518 et seq.
voluntary sacrifice. An element of liability to contribution in general average.
To satisfy the requirement of a voluntary sacrifice, that there may be a general average contribution toward a marine
loss, it is not enough that there be a deliberate intent to do an act that may or may not lead to a loss; there must be a purpose to
sacrifice the thing at all events, or at least to put it in a situation in which the danger of eventual destruction is increased. 48 Am
Jlst Ship § 627.
voluntary self-destruction. The taking of one's own life purposely and intentionally. Courtemanche v Independent Order of
Foresters, 136 Mich 30, 98 NW 749.
voluntary separation. A common ground of divorce provided by statute, the condition being a separation that is voluntary, on
the part of at least one of the parties, not forced as would be the case if the husband was inducted into the Armed Forces or
confined in prison. 24 Am J2d Div & S § 151.
voluntary settlement. A dissolution and winding up of the affairs of a partnership, effected by the partners without court
action.
See compromise; settlement; voluntary payment.
voluntary statement. A statement by the accused in a criminal prosecution, proceeding from the spontaneous suggestion of his
own mind, free from the influence of any extraneous disturbing cause.
A reason why admissions by defendants are only
[1352]
admissible when voluntary is that they should be received with great caution. because they may not be true, for the mind of an
accused, when oppressd by the calamity of his situation, is often influenced, by hope or fear, to make an untrue statement,
when, as a matter of fact, the truth would be better. Tuttle v People, 33 Colo 243, 79 P 1035.
See confession.
voluntary stranding. The stranding of his ship by the master to save the ship and her cargo from the greater expense which her
sinking then imminent would cause. Fowler v Rathbone (US) 12 Wall 102, 20 L Ed 281, 285.

negative one; and, to be authorized, the matter of the proposition must receive the greater number or majority of the votes. It
could not be a plurality, as might be when there are more than two candidates for office, and the one receiving the highest
