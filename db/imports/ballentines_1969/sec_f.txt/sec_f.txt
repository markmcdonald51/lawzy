reverted to him who granted it. See 2 Bl Comm 45.

cognizee) as that which he has by the gift (of his cognizor); wherein the cognizor acknowledges his gift of the land to the plaintiff,

as such may ultimately be required.
The fact that every fingertip has a series of convolutions in the skin surface, no two of which are alike, and which
students of the subject can classify and describe so as to facilitate search, has made identification of a criminal almost certain

For the purposes of a policy of forgery insurance: an act which, under applicable principles of criminal law, will amount
to the crime of forgery. 29A Am J Rev ed Ins § 1339. Of course, where a policy insuring against "forgery" contains its own

Falsification of a paper or the making of a false paper of legal efficacy apparently capable of effecting a fraud and a
fraudulent intent are essentials of the offense of forgery; and the falsity of the writing relates to the want of genuineness in its
making and not to the truth or falsity of the statements contained therein. To constitute forgery, the name signed on writings
designed and used as instruments of fraud need not be identical with that of the person whose signature it purports to be, but
merely idem sonans; and the use of a recurrent middle initial not in the simulated signature is not a fatal variance. Peoples Bank

society, it is just that for good cause the state should resume the property which the laws had assigned to him. See 1 Bl Comm
299.

spread between the carload rates paid by him to the railroad company and the higher rates, approximating less-than-carload

Those who deal in "futures" are divided into three classes: First, those who use them to hedge, i.e. to insure themselves
against loss by unfavorable changes in price at the time of actual delivery of what they have to sell or buy in their business;
second, legitimate capitalists, who, exercising their judgment as to the conditions, purchase or sell for future delivery with a view
to profit based on the law of supply and demand; and, third, gamblers, or irresponsible speculators, who buy or sell as upon the
turn of a card. United States v New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange, 263 US 611, 619, 68 L Ed 475, 477, 44 S Ct 225.
